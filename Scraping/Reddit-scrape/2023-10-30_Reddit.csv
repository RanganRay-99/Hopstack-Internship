shopify,A Guide to Prevent Fraudulent Chargebacks with Shopify Payments [2FA],2023-09-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/16nq45q/a_guide_to_prevent_fraudulent_chargebacks_with/,41,"I've found the most simple and effective method to stop scammers and prevent fraudulent chargebacks. This guide is made for anyone running a Shopify store and using Shopify Payments. 

It takes a minute to set up and it saved me thousands in chargebacks and product costs.

‚úÖÔ∏è **Setup guide:**

1. Open your Shopify Dashboard
2. Click on ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô
3. Click on ‚ÄòPayments‚Äô
4. Click on ‚ÄòManage‚Äô for Shopify Payments
5. Scroll down until you find the 'Customer Billing Statement' section
6. Add your ‚ÄòCompany Name‚Äô + 'Number Code' in the Customer Statement Descriptor. For example 'SP \* Ecom Zone 8426'
7. Update this code occasionally

‚úÖÔ∏è **How it works:**

For any medium/high-risk orders, email the customer and ask them to verify the number code that shows up on their bank statement. In the example above, the customer would have to provide the code: 8426. Place this order on hold until they verify your unique 4-digit code.

Most scammers will only have the stolen credit card details and will not have access to the cardholders' bank account to verify this code.

If they cannot verify this 4-digit code even after you help them locate it, then simply cancel the order.

If the customer provides this 4-digit code and still opens a chargeback after processing their order, then it is very likely that you will win as long as you provide the bank with all of the evidence.

&#x200B;

**‚úÖÔ∏è Use cases**

1. Medium-risk orders
2. High-risk orders
3. Multiple payment attempts
4. The billing address doesn't match the credit card details
5. The customer is shipping to another address with a different name
6. High-value orders
7. High-risk internet proxy used to place the order
8. The cardholder's name provided does not match the name on the shipping address"

Since we provide on-site services, I'd like to have a product priced in EUR for one of our services in Europe.

I need variants for the following:  
\- price adjustments based on the size

I've been testing numerous apps, but none seem to be able to create custom options that affect the price (they can allow selecting add-on products, and that's not what I want).  
They also can't seem to switch the product picture when changing color option.

I've tested numerous post-purchase upsell apps, and they were either: lacking customization, not providing a 1-click buy post purchase. (without the need to re-enter payment information), or overpriced.

After a long digging, I've discovered an optimal app for this very specific purpose: to provide post-purchase upsells, and as of Jan 14th it made me an additional $715.21 [As of today (approx. 3 weeks of use)](https://ibb.co/SnfwGqx)

**How it works?** **1)** After your client submits an order they'll be shown your upsell #1 offer which can have up to 6 products, and add any of those products to their order **without** filling our their payment information. (1-click buy)

**2)** If your client accepts the upsell #1 offer, they'll be shown upsell #2 (also up to 6 products). If they decline, a downsell offer will be shown (with a slightly larger discount, but that's your choice of preference).

**3)** You also get a chance to customize the order confirmation page (**Thank You Page**), so **every time** the client clicks on their order from the confirmation email, they'll see the products you have selected with the discount given.

The best part is they have a **free plan** if you get under 50 orders in 1 month, which would be great for folks that are just starting out in E-Commerce.

There's a lot more.  I've made a video to show its features and the final look. Feel free to check it out. Here's the link [Video Showing the app's features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L5cvZT0wXw&ab_channel=DmytroCommerce)

Also, the support team is top notch. Their devs implemented **7** small changes specifically for my store in a timely manner.

[Link to the App in Shopify Store](https://start.aftersell.app/join?via=app) (that made me an additional $715.21 after 3 weeks of use)

Hope this will help someone. Have a great day!"

**üéõÔ∏è¬†New Feature: EasyRoutes Dashboard**

Opening EasyRoutes now lands on the Dashboard,¬†providing quick access to common actions and a summary of your recent EasyRoutes activity. ¬†Complete the setup guide, create empty routes, access your orders, and view recently created or completed routes - all from one convenient landing page:

https://preview.redd.it/j942wk83jtrb1.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c5f029fd4aac79f05f9c42fe9ce207c06a69fd2

Stay tuned for future updates to the Dashboard as we add more information and shortcuts to help streamline your deliveries!

&#x200B;

**‚òïÔ∏è¬†New Route Option: Driver Breaks**

We've added a new route option that allows¬†you to schedule custom blocks of time for your drivers to take a break between delivery stops:

https://preview.redd.it/9p9dftb4jtrb1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=b48f17a22c05a1ffca7fb592be647dcd49731a57

Driver breaks can be enabled or disabled from the [Route Options](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/)¬†page for new and existing routes. Route Scheduling must also be enabled in order to properly assign a time slot for driver breaks.

**Note**: Drivers will need to update to the latest version (1.0.29 or above) of the [EasyRoutes Delivery Driver App](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) in order to view breaks within their routes.¬†

&#x200B;

**üõí Orders Page Updates**

We've updated the Orders page and Add Orders tab to speed up route creation and provide more details at a glance. ¬†When any orders are selected, the¬†**Add orders to map** button¬†now remains visible on screen, floating in the same position as you scroll through the page:

https://preview.redd.it/td2vz0l5jtrb1.png?width=2006&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1f48f53a0305011f754b1492012ee7c413852b5

Once an order has been added to the map, its checkbox will convert into a green checkmark, like #1020 shown below. Hovering over the green checkmark will change it into a delete icon, like #1021 shown below;¬†click this¬†to remove the stop from the map:

For completed routes or routes in progress, we've added a series of icons under the **Proof**¬†column for each stop to indicate which Proof of Delivery items have been captured:

https://preview.redd.it/0qp2ead8jtrb1.png?width=2764&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e98751466af16de2157ad204f4272d18dbaa644

Click on any available icon to open the Proof of Delivery panel and view photos, eSignatures, driver notes and GPS delivery locations attached by your driver.

**üìñ¬†Improvements to¬†Address Book & Order Imports**

We've adjusted the Address book to¬†simplify order import and saved stop workflows.¬†You can now click the dropdown arrow next to the Address book button and click **Import and add orders** to bypass the Address book panel and jump directly to the Import CSV page:

https://preview.redd.it/enzjdie9jtrb1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=c01ab51ed3bc93bee128da40cb4fd82da202c24c

Imported custom stops also now contain¬†three additional data variables: **Time window**,¬†**Stop time**, and **Stop note.**¬†All three of these variables are saved in the Address book entry for a stop, and will persist for any future routes that include this stop.  


**üì±¬†EasyRoutes Delivery Driver 1.0.29**

EasyRoutes Delivery Driver has been updated to version 1.0.29, featuring support for the new driver breaks feature, enhancements for manual geocoding, and improvements to items & fulfillment workflows.

I am also researching this issue.

In my role involving interactions with store owners and management, I have examined several stores and identified two common situations:

Firstly, some stores are not using any apps or not using enough necessary apps to establish credibility and professionalism. These stores often appear dull unless they have exceptionally beautiful and captivating designs.

Secondly, there are stores that use too many support tools without careful selection. They have constant pop-ups, multiple unused apps, subscription boxes, live chat, and more. In my opinion, using too many apps can make a store cluttered and chaotic, causing discomfort for customers and reducing the likelihood of return visits, thus hindering the purchasing process.

These are my general observations, but I have yet to find a solution to this problem and have a few questions:

\- How many apps are sufficient for a store?

\- Which apps are necessary for a new store?

\- How can apps be effectively utilized to achieve the same goal: increase revenue and minimize costs for the store?

I am currently struggling with this issue and would appreciate your insights and opinions..."

**üìñ New Feature:¬†Address Book**

The [address book](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) lets you manage your frequently used custom stops in EasyRoutes. Create address book entries with customer names, addresses, and manual items and you'll be able to easily add them to your new and existing routes.

The address book is accessible for planning new routes from the main **Orders** screen, as well as the **Add orders** tabs on Route and Group pages to add to your existing routes:  


https://preview.redd.it/u5g8fxx8y2nb1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=61a8f929f76c25a73eade2bf503b49842f7d56f8

Within the address book dialog, you can add and edit entries, then use the checkbox(es) to select one or more and add to your route.

üí° **Pro-tip:** Frequently used address book¬†entries can be pinned to the top of the address book by clicking the star icon to the left of an entry's name. ¬†If you have an address book with many entries, use the search bar to find exactly what you need.  


**üíæ¬†Updates to CSV Import Workflows**

We've relocated the **Import CSV** button and all associated functionality into the **Import history** tab of the new address book feature.

From the address book panel you can¬†import new CSV files containing custom stop data, and view any previous CSV imports and the stop data they contain:

https://preview.redd.it/rce0yncay2nb1.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=787d11166ac40a9fd47a5d2b12fd2e353d44d2b4

For more detailed information on CSV file¬†formatting and importing custom stop data into EasyRoutes using the [address book](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/), check out this [support article](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/).  


**üóìÔ∏è¬†Improvements to Partial & Scheduled Fulfillments**

We've increased the level of detail and user control for orders and stops that have partial fulfillments, which can be particularly useful for orders that ship from different warehouse locations, or scheduled fulfillments (such as subscription orders) that will be delivered on any future date(s). 

Once a route is created with a stop that contains a partial fulfillment, from the route page, all fulfilled and unfulfilled items included in that stop can be viewed by clicking the dropdown arrow in the Items column for that stop:

https://preview.redd.it/tzzdpwqby2nb1.png?width=2386&format=png&auto=webp&s=2253df1112a1efc38fe66b5bb5465324a0508f8e

By clicking Actions > Edit stop and scrolling down to the stop's Advanced options settings, you can see which portion(s) of the order have already been fulfilled, and select any/all remaining items to be included in this stop's current fulfillment. You can also view each item's fulfillment location to determine which warehouse location the items are shipping from:

https://preview.redd.it/6up30d1dy2nb1.png?width=1252&format=png&auto=webp&s=542f6db9f07a37c367c5bc34dff729f3c5713501

Once the stop has been fulfilled (depending on your [EasyRoutes fulfillment settings](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/), this may be manually triggered, or when a particular delivery status is applied to the order) the order page will now display any remaining unfilfilled items, and a breakdown of each past fulfillment, which items they contained, and which location they were fulfilled from:

https://preview.redd.it/5vhpnwkey2nb1.png?width=1302&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9ada48babaeb300736eac88007401f9d86162c7

**‚ö†Ô∏è¬†Address Accuracy Warning**

We've added a warning message when EasyRoutes is unable to find an exact match for a stop's address, often due to a typo or incorrect information entered in a customer's address field(s).

When applicable, the warning will display as a bubble on the stop's entry within a route, and as a banner at the top of the stop's Edit Stop page.

**üì±¬†EasyRoutes Delivery Driver 1.0.28**

EasyRoutes Delivery Driver has been updated to version 1.0.28 with various improvements and bug fixes. You can now require drivers using the app to add a note before they are able to mark an order as delivered. ¬†We've also improved iOS support for navigating with Google Maps when offline or experiencing limited network connectivity, and enhanced device authentication and user login on both the iOS & Android versions of the EasyRoutes Delivery Driver app.

* Improved UI for time windows on a route (e.g. see when time windows are not being used)

FulfillmentByAmazon,3 ways joining the Discord helped my FBA journey.,2022-07-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/FulfillmentByAmazon/comments/vyelj4/3_ways_joining_the_discord_helped_my_fba_journey/,34,"Hi everyone, I started my FBA business in December of 2020. It's a small but growing health and beauty brand, roughly $125k revenue in the trailing twelve months.

Joining the AmazonFBA Discord was one of the better decisions I've made, and I invite you to consider joining as well as it's a valuable resource for me. Here are my top three reasons you should join:

1. **The community**. My friends and family don't sell on Amazon or do e-commerce and I felt for a long time the desire to have community that is dedicated to the same thing I'm working on. The Discord gives me that. It's weird (maybe a little sad LOL) but I consider some of the members there to be my friends. 
2. **Direct/Point Blank Feedback**. Let's face it. This industry has a lot of passersby who are curious but don't actually intend on doing the work. This has caused Amazon Sellers to be very direct in their advice and feedback. This can be very beneficial. If you've done the research and have a creative question, you will receive direct but valuable feedback.
3. **Fast, Passive Learning**. I don't always read every thread, but will often skim through them just to catch up - as oftentimes it's entertaining as well (Sellers are funny). Doing this consistently has increased my FBA (and business) knowledge quite a bit. I now know little things about patent infringement, injection/composite molds, dealing with manufacturers, etc. that I didn't know before. It helps me plan out my path forward.

So I invite you to join us. Here is a link: [https://discord.gg/VcRZTsS](https://discord.gg/VcRZTsS)"

Based off the responses I received I was told to enroll in brand registry at the soonest. Being a startup, this is a bit costly on my end and wanted to ask you two things:

&#x200B;

1. Have you enrolled yourself into Brand Registry without a lawyers assistance? 

2. For those who have been through this, is it possible to use your own personal lawyer for the brand registry issue? My personal lawyer hasn't dealt with Amazon's Brand Registry before, but he is well-versed in intellectual property law. Would Amazon accept this, or do they require that we use lawyers from their IP Accelerator program?

 When I go to make an MCF order, I get a red banner saying 'Your account is deactivated at this time. Please call Support for assistance

 Things to note:  

1. I tried calling account health, but it just says 'They are unavailable to assist me at this time'
2. I called SS, they have created a case. They asked for a screenshot, as well as for my shopify URL? Which is weird.
3. I have been using a new repricer software (profasee) for 4 days now. I wonder if this could have something to do with it?
4. I have an ongoing issue with my UK account. I no longer sell there, and have deactivated my VAT number, but I have an account health warning in UK due to this. (All other accounts are healthy)
5. I have good account health, and no performance notifications
6. My listings all appear to be active, but I have no had a sale for 8 hours, and the last 2 days have been the slowest of the year for me.
7. Canada listings are also effected by the MCF ban, but still active.
8. In the last 24 hours; all the listings in my niche have lost thier BSR / Browse Node. Some have nothing at all, and some only show home and kitchen, and no sub-niche. I called Amazon to inquire, as I thought this may be why my sales are slow. They said its a known error, and they manually refreshed all my listings.

Hopefully, someone has seen this before! Thanks!"

AmazonSeller,/r/AmazonSeller - sub rules and wiki page updates,2021-09-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonSeller/comments/pro3uc/ramazonseller_sub_rules_and_wiki_page_updates/,3,"Hi,

thank you for participating in the /r/AmazonSeller subreddit. 

**NOTE:** This forum is neither run / moderated by Amazon employees, nor is there any guarantee that an Amazon employee will come to the sub, see your participation, and respond to it. **If you wish to discuss something with Amazon, then you should contact them through their site**

# A *caution* for all sub participants

First and foremost, an important reminder for all of you

We don't want you to get burned. ***This sub like ALL ecommerce forums is under a constant barrage from scammers / spammers / promoters / info farmers***.  Though we remove a large portion of it, some of these clowns do get through. No matter your skillset and experience, the following kinds of situations should set off red flags every time;

* contact me / send me / sharing / let's talk in private requests.  This is an attempt to scam you in private.  If they can't say it out in the open, don't trust them
* the SUPER helpful guru - especially the ones claiming to know everything and make so much money that someone actually in their position in the real world would never have the time for what they are doing here.  No actual millionaire is here seeking a buddy just like you to give all their secrets to. 
* people who have magical paid groups for ""secret sharing"" and paid courses with all the answers.  It's like throwing money in a trash can.
* anyone trying to reach you for interaction beyond this forum and has no physical contact info or tries to put hurdles in the way of actual IRL contact

These scenarios are more often an attempt to draw you in by someone lead generating for a service, info farming, or a scam.  Especially if you are new to selling or social media, your info and money are their goal so *be on your guard*.

# AmazonSeller Rules

We've updated, reorganized, and reduced them down to the following five rules (the bold parts are fine for 99% of you, but the rest of it is unfortunately necessary due to insincere people who rule lawyer and like to argue);

* **1) [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) is required** - Debating points is fine, attacks are off topic and not necessary to present a differing opinion. No vote complaining. Insults, flame wars, trolling, brigading, or antagonism towards the subreddit participants, the moderators, or even the community itself will be removed and may result in an immediate ban.

* **2) No Self-Promotion outside the [**Community Promotion Post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonSeller/about/sticky?num=2)** - This post is stickied 2nd from the top of the subreddit and is the ONLY place here to discuss or link to things you are affiliated with (anything by, about, or for you) including your; company or position within, site, service, product, app, article, video, product development, survey or market research, etc. Disclose any affiliations. 'Guru' posts are often lead generation, info farming, or scam attempts and likely to be removed. If the people who participate in this sub are the target market for you / your business, then take this rule seriously. Promotion violations will result in a permanent ban. There are no exceptions and appeals are not allowed

   **---> If you are an Amazon VA / Consultant, tread carefully in this sub**.  *Understand this is NOT the place to try to generate leads via any method, overt or implied.  You WILL be banned for it.* **<---**

* **3) No Amazon policy violation discussion** - You may not discuss intentionally breaking Amazon's system or intentional violation of their terms. This also includes anything which can be deemed as deceptive.

   *Note: Discussion of reviews is restricted* due to multiple issues; the topic has already been extensively covered, the frequency of deception, dishonesty and other forms of bad faith involved, the high amount of Amazon TOS violation discussion within these posts, and the constant targeting of this topic by bad actors for spamming, promoting, lead generating, and scamming purposes. Refer to [the Amazon Seller Product Reviews Policies page](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/YRKB5RU3FS5TURN) where the majority of questions on this topic are readily covered

* **4) No improper links** - Use direct links even in the [Community Promotion Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonSeller/about/sticky?num=2). Improper links will be marked as spam and removed. 

   * No affiliate links 
   * No indirect links including url shorteners, 3rd party linking, or masked links. 
   * No tracking links of any kind

* **5) Posting and commenting restrictions** - *Account age, prior account activity with positive comment karma, and prior participation in the comments here are all required to post in this subreddit*. Problem posts most often come from new account holders unaware of the rules OR scammers / spammers. Participate in the comments until you can post. Negative karma accounts may not post or comment here. Requesting exceptions or appeals may result in a ban.

* **6) Scam issue post types** - Due to the extremely high percentage of these involving scam issues, posts with the following kinds of content are not allowed;

   * Guru posts, often coming from VAs, consultants, devs, market researchers, and product or service providers
   * Posts with images
   * Account stat bragging or stat images
   * Any discussion or mentions of reviews / feedback or related services
   * Surveys or any form of market research
   * Service offers
   * Partnership seeking
   * Mentor seeking, ""I'll pay you to"", and other direct requests to be scammed

*For anything related to a ban, refer to the new ban appeal info page mentioned below*

# Wiki Page Updates

### [**The AmazonSeller Resource Wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonSeller/wiki/resources)

The resource post has been moved to a wiki page.  A link to this wiki will be added to pinned posts and the sidebar.  We will post from time to time seeking suggestions for additions OR we may approve trusted sub participants to add info to the wiki (this would require a long participation history in this sub without rule violations)

### [**Ban Appeal Info Page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonSeller/wiki/rulesbansappeals)

If you have been banned, you need to read this wiki page BEFORE you appeal.  It covers how to appeal, how not to appeal and what to avoid, when you can appeal, and includes links to info relevant to bans.

Thank you

Here‚Äôs my question. I have a largish quantity (maybe 500 each) of 2 configurations of an item that I would like to sell to get some seed money. The items are two sizes of stainless lunchbox‚Äôs. 

TL;DR: I got these items for free (well other than some heartache) because they were purchased by my ex through his wholesale business and sat in my garage for 2 years. He ain‚Äôt coming back for them! They are legally mine per our divorce agreement stating what possessions he can take from our house.

So, I feel like the quantity is large enough for FBA and the demand is there (I need a little more research into pricing) however since I have no real documentation around the source of the product. 

Since I have these items for free, the only thing I really have to lose is an mis step with Amazon that would prevent me from a larger operation later. For now I just want to sell what I have while to get some seed money and learn what selling on Amazon is like as I build my brand and set things up in the background. 

For this unusual situation, is FBA the way to go, or should I merchant fulfill to get things going?"

First shipment has 104 items and the second shipment has 52 items.  
  
I remembered when the shipments received by Amazon. the first shipment shown 91 items out of 104 received and second shipment has 44 out of 53 items received.  
  
Now a month later, the amount of items received is getting lower and lower and some of the items that showed as received before are now showing as receiving...  
  
Out of the couple thousands items I sent to Amazon before I have only lost 3 items...Now this time it lost 43 items in 2 shipments...And an item showed 4 available to sell yesterday now shows 3...  
  
Am I totally screwed here?  
  
BTW, I have no hope for reimbursement from Amazon too. Last time it happened I submitted the invoice and they just kept telling me they counted and they did not received them and closed my case...It is funny because on that case, the inventory showed received and then disappeared couple days later... and they can't find the record"

And with the lack of Resources out there, its easy to make a mistake (while choosing a product, choosing a supplier, etc.), and mistake is something you can not Afford, especially in a high-ticket business like Amazon FBA.

So I decided to Compile a list of helpful Resources/Groups/Communities that new Amazon Seller can refer to:

# 1. Amazon Seller Central

You might already know about this. Its a forum for Amazon Sellers, where you can ask about any Question you have.

If you have a query, you can try asking here.

But Its more or less like Reddit, sometimes your Questions can go unnoticed.

# 2. Twitter

Twitter is definitely the most helpful and reliable resource for any type of eCommerce.

Its also the easiest way to find suppliers, dealers, leads, etc.

I myself found my current supplier through Twitter, I was interacting with other seller on twitter, and someone recommended them.

This is a HUGE Amazon Seller Community created by fellow Sellers from Reddit & Twitter.

Its also has a complete step-by-step Guide to Selling on Amazon + a closed Discord Community of over **45000 Amazon Sellers** who can help you with your queries if needed.

Helium10 is known for its collection of tools helpful to Amazon Sellers. They have many free tools like Keyword Research, PPC audit, Sales Estimator, etc.

What I like most is their Free Keyword tool, helps in finding low competition keywords.

Keyword Research is an important step if you to make sure that your product ranks higher in Amazon Search. It can boost your product ranking by a lot if done right.

# 5. Google Trends

https://preview.redd.it/tq5d0blopqdb1.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&s=a89c9f4e4392c6bd3792db3219fccc5727056034

Google Trends can be a really helpful resource for finding trending products.

It can provide you info about all the current Trends in the market and show you what most people are searching on Google right now.

You can use this info and choose your next product according to the Market Demand.

In other words, you can use this tool to basically *cash out the hype.*

# 6. FBA Hustlers

Its a private Facebook group for Amazon Sellers. It has around 4000 Amazon Sellers. Its a decent place to talk to other sellers and get opinions / advice.

However the group has a really long approval time. I requested to join the group last month, and my request is not approved yet.

You can give it a try and see if you get accepted.

..............................

These were some Resources that I can think of rn.

Will definitely add few more to this list when I get time."

Let's say I have found a product $10 (half price), but even if I sell at $20 (and I can't sell higher because others are selling at that price max) , with either $10 shipping + $3 Amazon  or $7 fba + $3 Amazon fee , then there's a risk of return or package lost. Just not profitable. Free shipping is nearly everywhere these days, I need to consider how others are charging too when buyers can look around too. 

If sourcing from Alibaba, together with the shipping cost to US, then there's Temu and other sellers selling similar or identical products, pricing for a profit just isn't as nice from seller's perspective."

FBAadvanced,New to FBA,2023-09-28,https://www.reddit.com/r/FBAadvanced/comments/16txd1k/new_to_fba/,0,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I am looking to source a product from Alibaba. I have found the supplier. I have discussed the pricing and shipping. I have calculated the profit, and everything seems to align.

&#x200B;

I have questions about creating a new product, Amazon warehouse, and distribution services, as well as how to add a product I don't have on hand. 

&#x200B;

Let me elaborate:

1. The product is chosen. All I need to figure out is my package's design and size. Most likely, it will be a large or oversized product. The product itself is pebble-like soil(not considered actual soil)
2. I do not understand how to calculate what I need to pay for storage and distribution services as I am still in talks with the supplier about sizing and package design. I do have a GTIN that will represent my product, but I cannot add images yet. I can not create and verify the brand with Amazon for my product either.
3. For the supplier to give me an accurate estimate for shipping, I need to give them the address of the distribution warehouse, but.... Amazon will not give me that until I verify my brand, upload my product, and give them all the other details.

If you have any suggestions or are willing to engage in a discussion, I would love to hear more from people who know what they are doing."
FBAadvanced,When is the best time to ship for Christmas?,2023-09-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/FBAadvanced/comments/16ag91n/when_is_the_best_time_to_ship_for_christmas/,0,"Hi guys  
Christmas is on December 25th, and Amazon‚Äôs cut-off date for receiving is around December 1-3. Although Amazon can still accept shipments after December 1st, you may miss some events. During the peak season, the shipping time may be 2-3 days slower. It is important to choose the right shipping method.

1. Express; 3Ôºç9days
2. Air: 9-12 days
3. Fastest sea: 18Ôºç25days
4. Normal sea: 35Ôºç50days (unstable)

If your budget is limited, only Normal sea can maximize your profit. Then the best shipping date is **mid-October**, or even earlier, because the Normal sea is unstable, which is beyond the control of the carrier. Of course, we will give professional advice on which shipping method to choose.   
In the peak season, many people will use the combination of Air and Sea.  


**Note: Time according to each shipping method above. We'd better arrange shipment 5-10 days in advance.**  


In addition, we must always remind suppliers to complete the product within the specified time during the production stage. During peak seasons, production delays often occur. It makes you have to choose a faster shipping method to increase the cost. Therefore, please place an order from the supplier in advance, and follow up with the supplier for production.  


**Some causes of delays you need to know:**  
1. Production order overload causes delays  
2. Quality inspection failed  
3. Container space is limited. The cut-off time is advanced.  
4. Port workloads up, workforce down (strikes)  
5. Amazon's warehouse is full, it‚Äòs difficult to make delivery appointments  


If you don't want to miss Christmas,   
**September is a great time to place your order and October is a great time to ship.**  


Also, if you plan for Black Friday too. Then arrange shipping in September.

It's easy to fall into the trap of emphasizing low Cost Per Purchase and high ROAS, especially when targeting existing customers. However, your real growth potential lies in expanding your customer base. Here's a breakdown of what to consider:

**1. Diversify Your Ad Strategy:** Balancing ads that target new and existing customers is key. Allocate a significant portion of your budget to acquire new customers and a smaller portion for retargeting existing ones.

**2. Analyze Key Metrics:** Keep a close eye on metrics like New Customer ROAS and Cost to Acquire New Customers. These numbers will guide your strategy and help you gauge the effectiveness of your ad spend.

**3. Email Marketing:** To retain existing customers, invest in email marketing. It's cost-effective and can boost customer loyalty and lifetime value.

**4. Regular Data Review:** Consistently review your ad data to adapt your strategy as needed. Don't get blinded by seemingly great CPA or ROAS figures; focus on the bigger picture.

**5. Communication with Agencies:** If you're working with an agency, clearly communicate your goals and the importance of new customer acquisition. Make sure they align with your growth strategy.

Remember, a well-balanced approach that prioritizes both new and existing customers will set you on a path to sustainable, long-term success."

This is due to many factors, including collapsing market fundamentals and overcapacity in the market.  


One of freight brokers' biggest challenges is the freight rate collapse. Spot and contract rates have been low all year, and there is no indication that they will improve anytime soon.  


This strains brokers' margins, and many struggle to make ends meet.  


Another challenge facing freight brokers is the overcapacity in the market. There are simply too many trucks chasing too few loads. This keeps rates low and makes it difficult for brokers to find profitable business.  


The combination of these factors is leading to several freight brokerages failing.  


This trend will likely continue as the freight market deteriorates in the coming months.  


What does this mean for you?  


If you are a shipper, you may be able to negotiate lower freight rates with your brokers. However, it is important to note that the quality of service may suffer as brokers consolidate and become more selective about the loads they accept.  


If you are a trucker, you may have to be more prepared to negotiate rates and be willing to take on less profitable loads. It is also important to have a good relationship with your broker so that they are more likely to give you priority when loads come in.  


If you are a freight broker, you need to be very careful about the business you accept. Be sure to vet your customers carefully and avoid working with shippers who are at risk of bankruptcy. You also need to be prepared to negotiate rates and offer flexible terms to your customers.  


The freight market is in a state of flux, and it is important to be aware of the latest trends. This will help you to make informed decisions about your business and protect your bottom line."

This integration could redefine the logistics landscape, offering clients an end-to-end solution that only a behemoth like Amazon can provide.

But we've seen this before with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Initially, AWS was developed to fulfill Amazon's internal needs before opening it up to third-party merchants. This innovation led to AWS becoming a cornerstone of Amazon's revenue and a giant in the cloud computing sector.

Amazon could potentially unlock a revenue stream exceeding $100 billion, propelling the company into the realm of logistics giants."

#I. Introduction

##Definition of Dropshipping
A method of retail sales where the store does not maintain a physical inventory of products in stock but instead purchases the item from a third-party (typically the manufacturer or wholesaler) every time they make a sale and have the third-party ship it directly to the end consumer.

##The First Sale Doctrine and Dropshipping
The First Sale Doctrine is a USA legal principle that allows the buyers of a product to resell that product no matter what the copyright holder desires. This is incredibly important for dropshippers to understand.

From the Justice.gov website: ""The first sale doctrine, codified at 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 109, provides that an individual who knowingly purchases a copy of a copyrighted work from the copyright holder receives the right to sell, display or otherwise dispose of that particular copy, notwithstanding the interests of the copyright owner. The right to distribute ends, however, once the owner has sold that particular copy. See 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 109(a) & (c). Since the first sale doctrine never protects a defendant who makes unauthorized reproductions of a copyrighted work, the first sale doctrine cannot be a successful defense in cases that allege infringing reproduction."" 

read more here: https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1854-copyright-infringement-first-sale-doctrine

In essence the First Sale Doctrine allows the owner of a legally-purchased copy of a copyrighted item to sell or transfer that particular copy without obtaining permission from the copyright holder. This means that once a person lawfully purchases a copyrighted product, they have the right to resell it without infringing on the copyright owner's exclusive rights. You've seen this at resale shops, garage sales, online auctions, etc...

In the context of dropshipping, the First Sale Doctrine can be relevant because it allows dropshippers to sell products that they have legally acquired from a supplier without obtaining permission from the copyright holder. As long as the dropshipper has legally purchased the products and the products are genuine, they can be resold without infringing on the copyright owner's exclusive rights.

However, it's important to note that the First Sale Doctrine has its limitations. For example, it doesn't protect dropshippers who sell counterfeit or pirated products. If a dropshipper sells counterfeit or pirated products, they could still face legal action from the copyright owner. Copyright owners might also try and limit the usage of their copyrighted works from unauthorized dropshippers including photography, video, marketing materials, and other copyrighted works related to the product being sold.

In addition, some copyright owners may try to limit the application of the First Sale Doctrine by imposing restrictions on the resale of their products. For example, some software manufacturers include license agreements that prohibit the resale of their products. In these cases, dropshippers would need to comply with the terms of the license agreement or risk infringing on the copyright owner's exclusive rights.

When starting your dropshipping venture the First Sale Doctrine can be an important legal principle for you to understand and navigate, as it can impact your ability to sell certain products without infringing on the copyright owner's exclusive rights. 

**Example in the Wild:**  
There's an example out of Texas where an entrepreneur started selling products from the gas station Buc-ee's who does not have their own online store. Buc-ee's can't stop the resale, but they were able to request that the seller change the name of the store so that it did not confuse consumers that the store might be official. That entrepreneur visits their local Buc-ee's once per week, takes photos, selects new products to sell, and charges a fee to buyers for their efforts. *(note: This isn't exactly dropshipping since the merchant buys the product at retail then ships it themselves. It is merely an example of the First Sale Doctrine being applied currently)*

##Types of Dropshipping  
There are a lot of different configurations that all fall under the umbrella of 'dropshipping'. Here we are just trying to give you some basic descriptions of some of the main ones:  

* **Classic Dropshipping** - Simple enough, you sell a product at markup and order it from the manufacturer/wholesaler and they ship it to your customer for you. Most often this is done via ecommerce and is designed so the company has almost zero overhead outside of marketing materials.   
* **Print on Demand Dropshipping** - In this configuration a garment / object printing company uses expensive direct to product printing machines to print orders but also keeps the garments / objects in stock, ships them out on your behalf, and may also offer automation to keep your website / storefront updated.  *Note: this might also include a 3d-printing company or waterjet company*
* **Private-Label Dropshipping** - This is where a product is produced when your order comes in then packaged in a type of packaging you specify and your label added to the packaging before being shipped to your customer on your behalf.   
* **Retail Extension Dropshipping** - In this configuration a dropshipping merchant partners with a brick and mortar store that has no desire to run an online operation. They make a custom deal with this store and then sell their products online at a markup. When a sale comes through, the retail store fulfills it.  
* **Product Creation Dropshipping** - This is where a merchant might bundle products or pieces from the inventory of a supplier to create an entirely new product, sell that product via their website, and then have all of the pieces shipped out by the supplier to the customer. This is extremely rare.   
* **Virtual Kitchen Dropshipping** - In this configuration a local virtual kitchen is used to create food orders on-demand for your customers based on a recipe you create. The food is then typically also shipped/delivered by the kitchen or a delivery company they or you have an agreement with.   
* **Showroom Dropshipping** - In this type of Dropshipping, often referred to as ""Factory Direct"", a physical retail showroom is built where consumers can touch and feel examples of merchandise, but the merchant orders the product directly from the manufacturer instead of selling the floor model or a model from their own warehouse. This has become extremely common with furniture retail allowing smaller furniture stores to sell more inventory and have far lower overhead. Some argue this is not exactly dropshipping since the merchant sometimes has to purchase a small amount of inventory and sometime sells the floor model (especially when it is outdated). This is unlikely a good fit for a first time dropshipper.   
* **Sales Rep Dropshipping** - Most frequently this is done using commissioned sales representatives who go door to door selling a product or selection of products. Once the order is received by the sales representative they hand it off to a fulfillment team who then order it from the supplier to be shipped. This type is cumbersome to get started but might fit in certain areas. For example Quill sends reps door to door in office buildings taking orders for office supplies, since they are owned by Staples the office supplies are then shipped from a nearby Staples retail store or warehouse. Quill is not a dropshipper, but the same tactic is applicable, with a similar markup scheme. Like Showroom Dropshipping this would require a tremendous amount of effort and is probably most often not worth it. While door to door is the main way this is/has been applied it could also be done via catalog or phone calls where a sales rep is assigned to a client and takes the orders. What makes this tick is the human to human connection between the sales rep and the target client. It gets messy when the sales reps leave (which happens often) or the client's needs are changing quickly. Unless you have an amazing face to face personality, a big ticket item that is frequently needed and can be easily marked up 50% to 75%, and a known target customer group that is largely stationary, this is probably not a great fit.

##Benefits of Dropshipping  
1. **Less Upfront Capital Required** - Since you do not need to purchase bulk inventory to start dropshipping your costs will be far lower than starting a traditional retail store or ecommerce store.  
2. **Easy to Start** - With dropshipping you won't have to worry about things like packaging, shipping, managing a warehouse, managing inbound returns (unless you choose to), or keeping your products in stock.  
3. **Low Overhead** - Since you are not keeping inventory in stock you have a much lower overhead to worry about. You do not need a 3PL of fulfillment service, have to build or rent a warehouse, have to pay warehouse workers, have to establish your own logistics, have to license warehousing software or robots, etc...   
4. **Flexible Location** - With Dropshipping you can do it from anywhere. You can be in a beach house in Bali selling winter coats in Canada.   
5. **Wide Selection of Products to Sell** - As a dropshipper you can sell virtually anything that is in stock and doesn't have any legal issues surrounding it (i.e. copyright infringing products). This gives dropshipping businesses ultimate control over what products they do and do not list.   
6. **More Free Time / Or Side Income** - Once you have built a successful dropshipping operation you can stop working your full-time job and spend more free time doing what you want if you wish OR you can use dropshipping as a ""side hustle"" to make side income. This is because once smoothed out and working correctly, dropshipping can be incredibly efficient to operate. This is especially true for dropshipping stores that sell only a few items and those items are not just trending at the moment. Of course, once you find success in dropshipping you might want to devote more time to it, but the reality is that it is possible to take control of your own time versus a more traditional 9 to 5 work model.      
7. **Easier to Test** - Because you have such little overhead and requirements, you can test out a dropshipping model quickly, easily, and inexpensively.     
8. **Easier to Scale** - In many ways dropshippping is easier to scale than a traditional retail or ecommerce operation. Again, this largely goes back to lacking physical inventory. As long as your process of making a sale and then ordering from the provider is smooth, scaling can be done with far lower effort.  

##Challenges of Dropshipping   
1. **No Inventory Control** - Since you are not manufacturing the products or buying in bulk, popular products will not always be available from your supplier. For example a new streetwear t-shirt brand gets hot suddenly and you list it for sale on your website as in stock but they sell out quickly. Having to adjust your own inventory controls separate to the marketplace can be time consuming and cumbersome. This might also lead to erroneous sales, a poor customer experience, and bad online reviews / word of mouth about your store. There are some ways to mitigate or automate this, but most of them are still not great or have gone out of business. This is something you want to have a complete understanding of for every product you list for sale.   
2. **Low Profit Margins** - The biggest drawback to a dropshipping operation is that you frequently will have to operate on thin or low profit margins. This gives you very little room for error and less budget for marketing/advertising.    
3. **Low Barrier to Entry** - Because dropshipping is so easy to start doing, once a succesful niche has been identified it can quickly get burried in competition that spent almost nothing to get started. Because of the low barrier to entry those competitors oftentimes will drive pricing down in the space and can survive on much thinner margins if they can sell at increased volumes due to the lower pricing.    
4. **Shipping Issues** - No warehouse, no 3PL or fulfillment service, means no control over the shipping. If you source from different suppliers (or even the same supplier with their own issues keeping products in stock) then you are going to run into issues and complaints from customers when it comes to shipping times/speed, and quality of delivery. That's just part of the game. To counter this you should buy your own products periodically to experience what your customers might experience and find ways to improve the customer experience from that angle.  
5. **Branding is Much Harder** - It is extremely difficult to brand a dropshipping store largely due to the fact that you won't have any retail signage or customized packaging. Difficult, but not impossible. Affiliates have long had this problem as well, and it is easily overcome with content marketing and content curation, but these can be expensive to perform and you have to invest in what the brand means as well.     
6. **Supply Chain Issues** - When a problem happens in one of your many supply chains, as was a frequent occurrence during the COVID pandemic, consumers will look to you for help. You need to be prepared to make up for lost deliveries, broken items, etc... This problem grows exponentially the more products you carry from different suppliers.    
7. **Hard to Find a Niche / Segment** - Because of how easy dropshipping is to get started, the mind-bogglingly amount of products available, and the various other drawbacks mentioned above - it can be extremely difficult for a dropshipper to find a niche or segment and settle into it. First timers might feel the temptation to sell a myriad of different unrelated products as if they were their own mini-Walmart or mini-Amazon. Fighting that temptation and sorting through all of the available options to find a specific product or set of products can be difficult.
8. **Platform Policies and Rules** - Some (*or every*) platform (*i.e. eBay, Etsy, FB Marketplace, Amazon, FB Ads, etc...*) where you can sell products may have rules dramatically limiting how you can build your dropshipping business. Make sure you familiarize yourself with these rules and policies before you start building on a platform, because if you are in violation they can easily delete it all and send you back to square 0.

##How to use This Subreddit to Become a Better Dropshipper
No lies, this sub (and others dedicated to the industry) are filled with spammers and scammers. They compound the difficulty in making dropshipping work as they often: provide low quality help/tools, try to sell stolen works, repeat basic knowledge about the industry, are not experts or even experienced in retail/ecommerce/dropshipping.

Your mods (and Automod) work hard to remove these bad actors, but we can only do so much and ultimately a handful always slip through the cracks.   

###How to Detect a Reddit Scammer/Spammer   
In general, it helps to be really skeptical of anyone's motives in this space, but here are some tips to help you avoid the scammers that want to steal your money and derail your journey.   

1. **Before you start believing someone look at their account.** Scammers and Spammers almost always have to create new accounts as they get banned by mods/admins frequently. A new account with low comment karma and a lot of comments that look identical or really similar should be a massive red flag.   
2. **Look for clues in what they are selling / promoting.** Scammers and spammers often try to do the least amount of work possible to rip you off. A big red flag is if they are trying to give you a course/ebook/webinar created by someone else. If they are giving it free, it's probably malware; if they are selling it then it could be outdated/incomplete and most likely is stolen (i.e. ill gotten gains). If they are promoting a website or SaaS or dropshipping related service then examine their motives and their connection.  
3. **Did they ask you to DM them or did they DM you?** This is almost exclusively going to be spam or scam related activity. Real businesses in dropshipping / retail / wholesale are either too damn busy for one-on-one DM conversations or they have a web team dedicated to these conversations that would be explained on their website, in videos, and across social media. Everything else is probably not worth it.   
4. **Are you being shown some eye-popping hard to believe Shopify sales screenshot or video?** This is a big one for scammers, they like to show a stolen or faked Shopify sales dashboard screenshot that has $x,xxx,xxx in sales over a 30-day period and claim to have the golden ticket for you to get the same amount for some low price. It sounds tempting and could be true, but it's probably snake oil and fraud instead.   

###General Tips on Using The Sub   

1. **Always flair your posts!** - (*note: this is now a requirement*) While new to the subreddit, flairing allows users who come here to be helpful with others a way to easily find your post and get involved in the conversation. Anyone requesting a site review, a product review, or marketing/copy/etc... review should use the ""Review Request"" post flair. Anyone trying to buy or sell a service (even if offered for free) should use the ""Marketplace"" flair. If you're asking a single question use the ""Question"" flair and if you're trying to start a discussion about an industry topic use the ""Discussion"" flair.   
2. **Stop being so dang vague!** - A lot of posters to this subreddit only give partial information in their posts. For example ""I'm having trouble with Facebook Ads, thoughts?"" This is low quality and anyone who is skilled in this industry and interested in helping others will just keep moving right past it. Get detailed with your questions and discussion topics and you'll likely get more back in return. 
3. **For those trying to promote their Mentorship/Agent/Designer/Marketing/etc... other services.** - Spamming the same comment over and over again will GET YOU BANNED. Please engage in AUTHENTIC discussion in this sub or leave. IF a link to your website is appropriate and naturally fits a conversation, then posting it is fine. Please walk a thin line and lean to the side of not spamming comments.  
4. **Stop trying to post exact-match anchor text SEO spam!** - Using our sub to make a long-form post using ChatGPT then linking one of those words to your website/page is really dumb. First off it doesn't work and probably hasn't since about 2009, Secondly the moment a mod sees it we will mark the post as spam and ban your account. Instead create engaging content for the sub, again if your link is a natural fit to the content or has more information then it would be naturally appropriate to include it.  
5. **No one is going to give you all of the secrets in one post!** - Not a single soul ever made money in this industry just doing what someone on Reddit told them to. If you want to build a business and be profitable you are going to have to do a lot of work on your own and learn a lot as you go. Do not make posts here asking tons of novice questions hoping the Jeff Bezos of Dropshipping will see it, take pity on you, and give you the secrets to being a millionaire. There is actually a secret and here it is - it is hard work. Instead, use our sub to ask SPECIFIC questions when you get stuck or bounce ideas off of other dropshippers.  



#II. Starting Your Dropshipping Business

##Selecting a Platform for Your Store
With Dropshipping you really just need 3 things: A website capable of closing sales, a product to sell, and a way to reach potential customers. A lot of new dropshippers get stuck on building the website as there are never-ending ways of building a site these days and even no-site options such as Facebook Marketplace, eBay, Amazon, and Etsy. 

When we ran a poll last year /r/Dropshipping overwhelmingly preferred one CMS over all other options: Shopify. 

See that poll here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/rv3ptc/mod_poll_best_website_platform_cms_for/

Shopify is cheap but not free. As of publication the ""Starter"" plan is only $1 / month usd but is usually $5 / month usd. They have free competitors such as Shift4Shop, Weebly, Ecwid, Wix, and BigCartel. 

Shopify also has competitors that cost money without a way to use them for free, even if the CMS itself is free. Those include:   

* WordPress+WooCommerce (free, but you will likely need paid plugins, a paid theme, and monthly hosting).    
* BigCommerce   
* Magento  
* Squarespace  
* LightSpeed    

Again, Shopify tends to win out against most competitors. In some cases WordPress+WooCommerce might make sense for you, especially if you are good at managing hosting or doing some light coding work and want to build custom things for your store eventually. 

##Preferred Apps for Shopify 
The power of Shopify's simple to setup and use system is amplified by the third-party market of apps on their app store. These apps range in price from apps that are free to those that charge a modest monthly fee, and the range in application giving Shopify stores a ton of functionality not native to Shopify itself. App fees on Shopify apps help the developers maintain the code and keep updating it and pay for their server expenses to operate the app.

This is a brief and non-comprehensive list of apps that are known to help Dropshipping merchants enhance their customer experience or increase sales in some fashion: 

**SEO:Image Optimizer Page Speed App (Avada)**  
URL: https://apps.shopify.com/avada-seo-suite  
Price: Free or $34.95/month  

What you can do: Compress images for faster page loading speed, more page speed options, broken link checker, meta tag optimization, alt attributes, and Google Search Console integration. 

*Note: a recent price increase on their paid plan from $29/month to $34.95/month. You probably want to look for a cheaper or free alternative if they just keep increasing the price. SEO is important, but most is handled by Shopify. Biggest need is image compression and other page speed optimization.*

**Jump Links**  
URL: https://apps.shopify.com/toc  
Price: $1.99/month or $9.99/month  

What you can do: Add a Table of Contents to your Shopify blog posts automatically. If you write long-form blog posts with HTML headings these will be turned into a TOC. The higher plan level allows you to automatically promote related products which helps increase sales and builds internal linking.

*Note: Lots of recent upgrades, only app that automates adding products to your blog. Great fit for dropshippers doing content marketing. Write great content, rank that content with SEO or drive traffic with social media, and grow sales.*

**Ryviu**  
URL: https://apps.shopify.com/ryviu  
Price: Free, $6.99/month, $9.99/month,  $19.99/month  

What you can do: Display reviews across your Shopify site wherever you want, import reviews with or without photos from a variety of sources, send emails to gather reviews from your own customers, add Question and Answer functionality to products. 

*Note: You may want to be careful importing reviews from other providers. However, the rest of the toolkit is pretty solid.*

**Ilana's JSON‚ÄëLD for SEO**  
URL: https://apps.shopify.com/json-ld-for-seo  
Price: $399 one-time fee  

What you can do: Add rich Schema markup to your Shopify site in JSON-LD format. Enhances how your products appear in search results. 

*Note: a recent price increase from $299 one-time to $399 one-time. Steep price for most. There are other ways to generate JSON-LD Schema for Shopify that are less expensive or even free if you know what you are doing.*  

**Pebblely AI** 
URL: https://apps.shopify.com/pebblely-ai
Price: Free, $19/month, $39/month 

What you can do: Pebblely allows you to make better product images using AI. Start with a source photo of your product and swap out the background for one of 17-pre defined photo-realistic backgrounds or describe your own to the AI.

##How to Select a Niche
The number one tip successful dropshippers and merchants give to newcomers is ""find the right niche and you'll be successful"". 

Unfortunately this is usually where the discussion ends and the new dropshipper is left wondering what it means. First off a niche is defined in the context of business as ""a specialized segment of the market for a particular kind of product or service."" For example Walmart, Amazon, and Target try to carry every product a consumer might need or want, but Microcenter wants to carry wider selection of computers and related electronics and Nebraska Furniture Mart focuses on furniture. Niche's can be broad like those two examples or even more narrowly defined such as a business that only sells phone cases with unique designs or a business that only sells coffee tables. 

So, how do you know which niche to target? How narrow or broad should your niche be? Should you start with only one product or build a massive store overnight? 

Slow down there killer, let's take this in smaller chunks and answer each question one at a time. 

**How do you know which niche to target?**  
Selecting a niche is hard and there is no one real answer that fits every dropshipper. There are, however, some general rules to help you get started.   
1. Stick with what you know - If you know a lot about building robots, or computers, or drones, or dolls then consider a niche in those areas. Is one of your parents an interior designer and as such you learned a lot about bathroom design growing up? Then consider bathrooms to be your niche. Sticking with what you know gives you a big advantage over most of the competition in the marketplace because most of your competitors big and small will have no knowledge and zero experience in the industry.    
2. Pick a niche you are passionate about - Maybe you're a lawyer and discover that your real passion is Warhammer 40K. You could start looking at just Warhammer as your niche or board / card games in general. Similar to being knowledgeable about an industry, being passionate about what you dropship will give you a leg up on competitors who are just trying to make the most profit as quickly as possible.       
3. Pick a niche with big ticket items - The simplest ways to make a lot of money is to make a lot of sales in small amounts or a few big sales. Think about a niche where the consumers are willing to pay big money, even without experience or passion for it you might be able to sell a few products and make a big profit.   
4. Pick a niche with low prices and high margins - Another way to make money quick is to sell a lot of products at a cheap price that consumers consider a good price or even a deal. The pricing and volume of consumer need/want drives most of the sales here and your passion or knowledge might be less important.   
5. Pick a nice that you are comfortable with - I know you have read or seen videos about how you can get rich fast with dropshipping. And while possible, it is probably more the exception than the norm. The reality is you will be doing this for at least a few years if not longer. So do not sell adult toys if you do not want to look at them daily, do not sell hygiene products for the opposite gender if it makes you uncomfortable.   

The important thing to remember here is that NO ONE can tell you which niche to select. You can get input from family, friends, mentors, and even get-rich-quick influencers and you can get data from tools that track trends, but you have to make the decision on what to target. For example if you sell real estate as your full-time career and have zero interest in fitness, even if all of the people you trust and tools you use tell you that fitness is a winning product niche, you should avoid it and find something that might be less of a great target but that you can stick with.

**How narrow or broad should your niche be?**   
That is up to you. A few things to keep in mind here there though:  
1. A narrow focus makes success easier in the short-term, but might provide friction to expanding your selection later.  
2. Single product or a few product stores using exact match or near exact match domains might sell well for a small period of time and perform well in SEO and could be good targets to resell later on if you do not want to stick with them, but often (not always) lack the branding potential for long-term success.  
3. A narrow focus is for easier to manage than a wide focus and vice versa. If you have only a little extra time to spare, then consider starting as small as possible.    
4. In some cases consumers consider a wide focus messy or untargeted but trust a narrow focus more and in other cases it is the exact opposite. Before deciding how wide to start you might do some cursory research or thought experiments. For example if you sell dehydrators for beef jerky and use the domain ""BeefJerkyDehydrators.com"" you will lose access to consumers who want to store fruits and vegetables or use it for other things, but you would win for anyone wanting to make just beef jerky.

#III. Marketing Your Dropshipping Store / Products
Understanding and executing great marketing is paramount for your dropshipping venture to be successful. This is an incredibly deep topic, which we will only be able to touch on a little bit here. 

##Possible Marketing Channels 
Before you spend any money on marketing, it is important that you understand what a marketing channel is and how you might use them. A marketing channel is essentially a tightly-related group of sources where you can run marketing or advertising campaigns. Marketers often think of these like ""buckets"" helping them to visualize where sales come from, understand what buckets provide the best sales for the money spent, what the cost of sales in each bucket might be, and if it would be possible to gain more sales from a certain bucket.   

* **Social Media Advertising** - Also called ""Paid Social"" or referred to as just the channel (i.e. Facebook Advertising). This is a marketing channel where you use photos or videos + advertising copy to reach your target audience and convince them to purchase your product. You pay each platform a fee, often in terms of number of people/accounts reached, in clicks to your site, or for a sale. 
* **Organic Search** - The marketing tactic that targets this channel is known as ""Search Engine Optimization"" or ""SEO"". This is where you attempt to position your website/pages higher in a general search engine by doing things that might give that engine signals that you are better to rank highly than other options. In most cases this takes time to drive sales and to be effective, but you do not pay the engine a penny. Instead your expenses here are focused on whatever you believe will gain the right collection of signals/scores to obtain the rankings you desire.   
* **Paid Search** - Also called ""PPC"" or ""Search Engine Marketing"" or ""Keyword Advertising"". This is where you buy ads on a search engine based on keywords your target customers might be using. Typically these ads are paid for on a per click basis or a target cost for each sale made.   
* **Organic Social Media** - Also known as ""Social Media Marketing"" or just ""Social Media"". This is where you/your store brand simply engage in online public forums collectively known as social media in hopes of driving sales. You can build your groups on Facebook, subreddits on Reddit, twitter accounts, etc... and try to gain as many members/followers as possible from your target audience. Then post messages / marketing materials to them.   
* **Content Marketing** - This is where you create content that your target customers might find really interesting or useful or funny. These target customers then help you by sharing the content on your behalf, driving Word-of-Mouth, and building inbound traffic. Some of that traffic can be shown products that they might want to purchase. Content can include blog posts, infographics, YouTube videos, podcasts, etc... 
* **Email Marketing** - This is where you send emails to non-customers or current customers to try and drive sales. You might also run your own email newsletter or buy ads in email newsletters and consider those part of this marketing channel.  
* **Podcast Advertising** - This is where you buy ads on Podcasts your audience might listen to in hopes of driving sales.  
* **Out of Home** - Also called ""OOH"" or ""Traditional"" this marketing channel includes things like billboards, bus benches, subway advertising, terrestrial radio, or other things that are often found by consumers while they are out and about in their city / area.  
* **Over the Top** - Ads on video streaming provides such as Roku and Hulu are often called OTT.  
* **Influencer Marketing** - Where you pay social media influencers with large followings to drive sales for your store.  
* **Public Relations** - Also called simply ""PR"" this is where you hire a PR agency or consultant to help you develop campaigns that seek to gain organic media mentions in the press, which then drives branded searches, which drives traffic to your website.   
* **Referrals** - A more nebulous channel where traffic and sales are derived from organic mentions that include links not placed or controlled by you, your staff, or your contractors/agencies. This is essentially tangential traffic that happened to come to your website and make a purchase and is difficult to build marketing plans for. For example if you did a PR promotion 4-years ago and a YouTuber talked about it, then included a link to this in their description, that link drove traffic, and some of those visitors purchased this might fall into your ""Referral"" channel because we know where they came from but did not use direct marketing to obtain the referring traffic. If this was a paid arrangement it would be our Influencer channel and if we determined it stemmed from our own social media work it would either go into our paid or organic social media channel. Because the origin is so hard to determine and because this channel is extremely difficult to target and optimize, especially as a beginner, you should just understand that it exists and focus efforts elsewhere knowing  there will be some bleed over.

## What Marketing Channels Other Dropshippers Find Successful  
We polled this subreddit to find what marketing channel dropshippers found the most successful.  You can view that poll here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/12avh86/mod_poll_what_marketing_channel_drives_the_most/

We asked ""What channel drives the most sales for your operation?""  
Here are the results:   

* **Paid Social** - 50.0%  
* **Social Media (unpaid)** - 21.73%  
* **SEO** - 17.39%  
* **Content Marketing** -  6.5%  
* **PPC** - 4.3%  

## Known Successful Marketing Approaches 
The sub will lend more details here later. Based on the above channels and experiences here are the approaches known to be successful. They are not always going to be successful:  

1. **Make a 9x16 video showing how the product works** (or hire someone to) and run this along with copy as a Facebook / Instagram / TikTok ad.  
2. **Invest in QUALITY SEO tactics** such as inbound PR for link building, writing great product descriptions, and making your site more technically sound.  
3. **Pay a social media influencer** to use your product for you. Works best on Instagram or Twitter or TikTok. FB Groups or Personal Facebook accounts might work too, but Facebook's algorithm destroys these kinds of posts on Pages.  
4. **Build a closed Group** and use it to sell or bounce ideas off of your audience. You can do this on Facebook, Reddit, Discord, or possibly even LinkedIn.  
5. **Setup a Google Merchant Center account** and gain free sales from Google or run Google Shopping Ads.  
6. **Do Content Marketing or Curation using a blog** and when it is a good fit recommend your related product(s) to readers.  You can run ads to these, share them to your social media audience, use email marketing channel, or just allow them to bring in organic search traffic.   
7. **Build a non-branded Humor-focused social media account.** On Twitter, IG, TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, or maybe even Reddit build a social media account that is focused on being funny about a topic or topics your target audience might be interested in. Then post your products to them from time to time or use this audience to drive traffic to another marketing channel (i.e. content marketing, email marketing, or paid social retargeting to name a few). For example an IG meme page for Nursing life called ""Nursing Memes"" for a store that sells scrubs.

dropshipping,Mod Update: New Rules Out - Ban Hammer Dropping,2023-07-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/14ox4r2/mod_update_new_rules_out_ban_hammer_dropping/,10,"Dropshippers, 

We have updated the rules in this sub and have began enforcing them with gusto today in hopes of ridding our community of predatory users that come here to try and scam others.

We have worked hard to make these rules fair, descriptive, and to ensure they will only adversely impact those who spam here in an attempt to scam or harm others.  

While these rules are technically new, they merely codify things we have already been enforcing and give a little more clarity as to what is happening.

Among the changes you might notice are banning users immediately if they reply to a post with phrases like ""come inbox"", ""check messages"", or ""inbox me"" - as well as clarity around what we consider to be ""Inauthentic Engagements"" i.e. various marketing tactics used to lure dropshippers into something that may not actually benefit them. 

The new posted rules also give the mod team the ability to take down posts that are not descriptive enough. Right now on the homepage there's a top voted post simply titled ""Dropshipping"". Low quality posts like this make it hard for interested users to actually get involved, attract mostly scammers, and overall drag this sub down. Starting today we may remove these posts as non-spam and simply mark the rule violation allowing the OP to repost with a higher quality title or content.

As users of this sub your input is highly valued. Please give us feedback on these rules and if there is something you would like to see us accomplish in the comments below."

dropshipping,The Benefits Of Starting A Dropshipping Business,2023-10-30,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/17jmapc/the_benefits_of_starting_a_dropshipping_business/,0,"# The Benefits Of Starting A Dropshipping Business

Are you thinking about starting an online business but don‚Äôt have the capital for inventory or warehousing? Dropshipping may be the ideal solution. Dropshipping allows you to sell products online without keeping stock on hand. When a customer places an order, you purchase the item from a third party and have it shipped directly to the customer.

This hands-off fulfillment method comes with many advantages for new ecommerce entrepreneurs. Read on to learn the key benefits of starting a dropshipping business.

## Low Startup Costs

The biggest appeal of dropshipping is the low barrier to entry. With traditional ecommerce, you need to invest thousands upfront in inventory. But with dropshipping, you can open your online store without this large capital investment.

Without having to pre-purchase and store products, you can launch your business for less than $100. All you need is a laptop, internet connection, web hosting, and a dropshipping supplier. This makes dropshipping ideal for bootstrapped entrepreneurs and side hustlers looking to test a business idea.

If the business doesn‚Äôt work out, your losses are minimal. But if it succeeds, the profits can be immense compared to the low startup costs. Dropshipping lets you get your foot in the ecommerce door for a fraction of the typical cost.

## Easy Scalability

Another major benefit of dropshipping is easy scalability. As your business grows, you can scale up without major investments. Again, because you don‚Äôt stock inventory, you don‚Äôt need more warehousing space and labor to support expansion.

You also don‚Äôt have to deal with tied-up cash from massive inventory orders. Your supplier stocks, packages, and ships each order as it comes in. This gives you the flexibility to grow sales exponentially without logistical bottlenecks.

With traditional ecommerce, scaling too quickly can overwhelm your operations. But dropshipping‚Äôs lean fulfillment method lets you expand your product catalog and sales at will. If a product takes off, you can ride the viral momentum without capacity constraints. This agility helps you maximize opportunities for growth.

&#x200B;

## Low Overhead Costs

In addition to minimal startup costs, dropshipping means keeping your ongoing overhead expenses low. Again, because you don‚Äôt have to manage physical products in a warehouse, you avoid those hefty operational costs.

Expenses like rent, storage, equipment, and labor add up fast in traditional ecommerce. With dropshipping, those costs are outsourced to your supplier and distributor. Your only real overhead costs are marketing, customer service, and the dropshipping fees.

This lean overhead structure increases your chances of running a profitable business. You get to devote more revenue to critical growth areas like marketing instead of just keeping the lights on. Lower fixed costs also reduce your breakeven point so your business becomes profitable faster.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uzpam42cx9xb1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96d32cfeca167cfb33c081090c479b2f2815ad0c

## Minimal Risk

Compared to traditional retail, a dropshipping model carries less risk. As mentioned, your upfront investment is minimal. You also don‚Äôt have to worry about getting stuck with excess inventory that you can‚Äôt sell. With dropshipping, you only order items after they‚Äôve been purchased by a customer. There‚Äôs little risk of deadstock accumulating and tying up your working capital.

Because you don‚Äôt own the inventory, returns and fraud are also less of an issue. Your supplier handles defective merchandise and refunds. This saves you headaches down the road if issues arise. The overall minimal risk gives you more confidence to start a dropshipping store versus other more capital-intensive ecommerce models.

## Location Independence

Another benefit of dropshipping is you can run your business from anywhere with an internet connection. You don‚Äôt have to be close to a warehouse or facilities. The day-to-day of managing a dropshipping store can be done remotely.

This location independence offers entrepreneurs great flexibility. You could run your online store while travelling the world or from the comfort of home. Some sellers even operate stores while working a separate full-time job. The hands-off logistics of dropshipping facilitate a portable lifestyle.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/95l9zl8hx9xb1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cae79c3b1b9df40b285326e38a0a8bdeb179ea61

## Easy To Automate

Due to the streamlined operations, dropshipping businesses are easy to automate. After the store setup, most of the repetitive tasks can be automated. This includes order processing, customer service, and marketing activities. Automation solutions like Oberlo for Shopify help minimize the manual work needed to run a dropshipping business.

With automation, you can essentially run an ecommerce store in your spare time. The automation software handles the busywork so you can focus on high-level strategizing and growth. This is appealing for entrepreneurs who want the benefits of an online business without the headache of dailyoperations.

## Wider Product Selection

Compared to carrying your own inventory, dropshipping gives you access to a much wider catalog of products. Instead of stocking a few hundred SKUs in a warehouse, you can offer thousands of dropshipped products in your online store.

Because you‚Äôre pulling from multiple supplier warehouses, your virtual inventory is endless. If you can sell it and your supplier stocks it, you can add it to your product lineup. This extensive selection makes it easier to meet customer needs under one roof.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hbrvrn0ux9xb1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fa549e58db3e1fcc175b5c52e95eea8ab5b788c

## No Need To Handle Physical Products

If you dread handling and shipping physical products, dropshipping keeps your online business 100% digital. You never have to touch the inventory, package orders, or haul boxes to the post office. Your entire job is managing the online storefront and branding.

Many entrepreneurs prefer this hands-off dynamic. You get the benefits of running a commerce business without the logistical hassles. The supplier handles purchasing, packaging, and shipping the products. All you do is connect the customer with the merchandise through your digital platform.

Dropshipping also eliminates steps in the value chain like quality control and returns handling. For the product-averse, dropshipping provides an attractive alternative to other ecommerce models.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0m3aksmvx9xb1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c8678f5cd9cfa19ddc7647b2210e4fae2ff2ff8

## Built-In Supplier Relationships

When you launch a dropshipping store, suppliers provide the product catalog and fulfillment. This gives you access to an established supply chain without having to build relationships from scratch. Because the dropshipper handles procurement and shipping, your business has built-in support.

With your own warehouse and inventory, you‚Äôd have to find suppliers, negotiate terms, handle logistics, etc. But dropshipping suppliers provide ready-made infrastructure. You get to focus on marketing and storefront branding while they execute behind the scenes. This symbiotic relationship with suppliers lets you get to market faster.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0wqoefzwx9xb1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c67fe30af9d24934b6e8f897bdd130d796f474b9

## Lower Risk Of Excess Inventory

Excess inventory is one of the biggest risks facing ecommerce businesses. You invest thousands in products only to have them pile up unsold in the warehouse. With dropshipping, the supplier handles inventory management. They store the products until an order comes through.

Because you only buy inventory as needed to fulfill orders, there is little risk of deadstock. The supplier takes on the risk of stocking too much. If a product drops in popularity, you simply remove it from your online catalog. The flexibility of on-demand inventory reduces the headaches of managing surplus products taking up space and cash.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sgy65ahyx9xb1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b2e643ecd28630cd3bbaba184cac1aec91d112f

## Focus On Customer Acquisition

Without juggling the complexities of operating a warehouse, fulfilling orders, and managing inventory, dropshipping lets you concentrate on customer acquisition. You get to devote your energy to marketing, branding, and driving sales.

Inventory management is off your plate. The plug-and-play fulfillment system gives you time to focus on business growth rather than operations. For entrepreneurs who enjoy strategic marketing more than tactical shipping logistics, dropshipping provides a welcome service.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eafs3yjzx9xb1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e7a99db31fa03accc916d4257fe402702cd06dc

## Low Commitment

For new entrepreneurs, dropshipping offers a low-commitment way to validate a business idea without excessive risk. Because startup costs are minimal, you can quickly launch a store and see if your concept resonates before investing more. If the store fails, you pull the plug without losing much.

This low barrier to entry allows for fast experimentation. You get to test products, marketing channels, and target segments without heavy operational investments upfront. Dropshipping provides an ideal launchpad to refine your business model while limiting financial risk. The low commitment helps take the scariness out of starting an online business.

&#x200B;

## Accepts Multiple Sales Channels

With a dropshipping model, you‚Äôre not limited to selling through your own independent storefront. You can list your dropshipped products on multiple channels like Amazon, eBay, and Walmart. This multi-channel strategy helps you maximize exposure and sales.

These third-party marketplaces already have huge built-in audiences. Listing your products there provides instant access to millions of additional customers. And you still fulfill orders through dropshipping so you don‚Äôt have to carry added inventory. The flexibility to sell across channels amplifies your reach.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tjsblee1y9xb1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=950a26fa43a707d5c4a99281d3d86103fd59bb64

## No Need To Develop Products

Product research and development can be challenging. With dropshipping, your suppliers already created the products. You simply choose items from their catalog to market and sell. This saves you from investing months of R&D into designing, prototyping, and manufacturing your own products.

Instead of developing something from scratch, you get to piggyback off existing products that are already selling. Let the supplier handle turning an idea into reality. You benefit by selling a proven commodity without the headaches of product development.

https://preview.redd.it/ep0bn8f2y9xb1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb4dc71db36c967bef33e856e16f46c2a50743f7

**Overall**, the advantages of dropshipping provide a remarkably accessible and low-risk path to ecommerce business ownership. By leveraging dropshipping suppliers for fulfillment, you can get an online store up and running in almost no time with little investment.

You also minimize overhead costs and risks associated with managing your own inventory. At its core, dropshipping provides an incredible opportunity for entrepreneurs. You get to own an exciting online business without dealing with logistical hurdles and barriers to entry.

Where do you think I would succeed the most? What's worth trying to get into nowadays?

I keep hearing that strong warehouse and logistics managers are few and far between these days. I'm 23/yo with a bachelor's of science in applied management (operational design was my strongsuit). While studying at school, I was also the full time receiving and back end operations lead /mentor for a Lowe's store for over two years (I still work there). Pay is ass but it was really my college job to help me pay for classes, but I took it just as seriously at school. I'm the step-in for the operations manager when they aren't in, and with how short staffed we are at our store, I've been having to step up a lot because he keeps getting sent to overnights to help them.

I can do his whole job and have been doing it, while also directing all the receiving operations and delegating work to the receivers that work in my department. I'm somewhat of a perfectionist but we can't hold on to people because for the pay, no one wants to bust their ass doing the dirty work of the store. I honestly love how fast paced and stressful the work is... it keeps me on my toes and I do great in a crisis, which there almost always is one at my store. I've had to step in for my installs coordinator on a weekly basis, I support my deliveries coordinator, I make sure everything being received is done to the best degree possible, all the while doing administrative tasks such as safety walks, shipment audits, scheduling/coordinating outgoing and incoming shipments, verifying and filing the departments documentation, etc. If it weren't for the fact that I loved the work, I would have left long ago as I am severely underpaid for what it do. Wasn't really working for the pay though, I was working for practice for my future career and building a strong work ethic. As a result, I now have over two years experience in my line of work perfecting what I do, while also graduating on the presidents list with straight A's for my 4 year degree (my grades kinda sucked my first year of school, so this is huge for me). I also got an associates degree in science while studying at school, which has a focus of biochemistry, but I learned a lot of that for my own interest and eventually decided I didn't want to work directly in biochemistry, but I can see how that might help me work with logistics that involve hazmat handling and the sort. 

If you are/were an employer or In a potential role for me, what jobs do you think it would be wise of me to pursue? The thought of being a logistics manager or warehouse manager is most comfortable to my skills and work experience, but I want to see what else is out there and who else could value my skills. I can pass any drug test and I'm also really experienced on 4+ types of driveable and lift equipment. I value the importance of accuracy and efficiency in a job such as described above, and I want the company I work for to value that as well...otherwise, I'd feel like my skills are being wasted.

Any recommendations, advice, concerns, or any general comments or questions are more than welcome. Whatever I do, I'm trying to make real money (like most people), but I'm willing to bust my ass to get it. Let me know what you all think."

I worked as a public employee and I had a real bad workplace accident which forced me to retire and now I collect my disability pension benefits.  To supplement my pension income, I started a consulting business under a Single Member LLC. 

The rules of my pension are that if I make more than what my former position's base salary, it's deducted from my pension benefits. For example (not real figures), if the salary of my former job was $100k/yr and my current pension is $50k, I'm only allowed to make an additional $50k. If I make more than an additional $50k, then my pension benefits will be adjusted so that I'll only make $100k. If I earn more than $100k/yr , then I'll forfeit all pension benefits. This restriction expires on my 50th birthday which was the pension plan's earliest retirement age. 

I didn't anticipate making this much money and I really don't want to ""work for free""  so I'll admit it's a good problem to have. 

Can I pay myself as a W-2 employee and file my company's taxes as an S-Corp? If I file my LLC's taxes as an S Corp, will the LLC still show on my personal income like it did when I filed as a sole proprietor? 

That way I can control my personal income and just invest the rest of the companies profits until I turn 50 which is about 15 years away.

This will result in at least 1 but maybe 3 months where my family barely makes any profit, but I argue if they and we just tighten up the hatches for that small period of time, use our comfortably sized nest egg, then we can have a team thats stable for more than 3 months at a time AND we can finally grow by being able to aggressively pursue new clients

My family's very against this and thinks I'm a naive socialist, basically. I'm a little out of arguments.  


Edit: More context. Our business really dies down in the winter, so we often lose employees and then scramble to find new ones when business picks up in March. We have only one employee thats been with us longer than a year, and shes been with us for 10 years. she's leaving in january. The business owners are looking to retire so they also can't do their usual amount of contributing, but they seem to think they'll be able to maintain the same profit margin without changing anything.

While the idea sounds enticing, I think it's important to demystify this concept.

In reality, what many label as ""passive"" income usually requires significant upfront effort, continuous oversight, and regular adjustments. Whether it's writing a book, setting up an online course, or investing in stocks, none of these avenues guarantee income without some level of involvement.

It's easy to get enticed by online gurus painting a picture of lounging on beaches while checks roll in. But behind every ""passive"" success story, there's a tale of hard work, persistence, and constant learning.

Does this mean passive income ventures are not worth pursuing? Absolutely not. But let's approach them with realistic expectations and the understanding that no reward comes without effort.

What are your thoughts and experiences on this? Would love to hear from the community!"
smallbusiness,"""taking your emotions out of the equation"" when hiring and firing, please help.",2023-10-30,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/17jap6r/taking_your_emotions_out_of_the_equation_when/,10,"I'm an emotional/empathetic (and perhaps doormat) person and owner, and I have an employee that I think I have to fire. They've taken 4.5 months off this calendar year (that I've said yes to, covered for, found coverage for). I've said yes because I wanted to give them that time and figured it would come back around. But it hasn't. It's also so stressful for me to cover these shifts.

Some advice I've gotten that's helpful:

- Your behavior sets the expectation for everyone around as to what's allowable and ok. If there's an example they can point to of you doing something then it's ok to do always.
- The mentality is that the employees on their best day will be only as good as you are on your worst day.
- You need to treat the employee with care and respect even when they don't treat you that way. Don't let other people's actions dictate your behavior. 


I think I am doing all of these things, but it's so frustrating that this person has no sense that just because I can cover their shifts doesn't mean it doesn't burden me and others. It's a well paying job if done full time, like $75k year. I already cut their hours in half to part time because I could not physically work extra hours. It wouldn't be so bad if they expressed any interest in reciprocation of covering shifts. I've asked and been rebuffed many times. 

I did set a policy of not allowing more than 24 days off after the initial issue, but because we hired a new person to help them out (issues at another business and they needed a job fast), problem employee immediately capitalized on it and asked for more vacay even knowing this policy. I again, said yes, my bad. 

Now that person I hired I like better. They have higher tickets, know more about the product, are a better employee while also being skilled in the way the other employee is. They also have an acute sense of how much time off is fair. They're just vibing the industry we work in a lot better. 

I'm sure the advice will be something like ""it's hard, but just fire them."" Am I misinterpreting something? Should I have done something different like say no to their vacation requests just because I don't want to? We're so small, like 2 front facing people, coverage is me or basically no one. How do I handle this inevitable conversation? I have actually never fired anyone before because we've had so few employees in our time with this business. I know it's stupid, but if anyone has any resources on the structure of the conversation I need to have with problem employee. I'd appreciate it."
