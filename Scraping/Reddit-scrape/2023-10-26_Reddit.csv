shopify,A Guide to Prevent Fraudulent Chargebacks with Shopify Payments [2FA],2023-09-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/16nq45q/a_guide_to_prevent_fraudulent_chargebacks_with/,41,"I've found the most simple and effective method to stop scammers and prevent fraudulent chargebacks. This guide is made for anyone running a Shopify store and using Shopify Payments. 

It takes a minute to set up and it saved me thousands in chargebacks and product costs.

✅️ **Setup guide:**

1. Open your Shopify Dashboard
2. Click on ‘Settings’
3. Click on ‘Payments’
4. Click on ‘Manage’ for Shopify Payments
5. Scroll down until you find the 'Customer Billing Statement' section
6. Add your ‘Company Name’ + 'Number Code' in the Customer Statement Descriptor. For example 'SP \* Ecom Zone 8426'
7. Update this code occasionally

✅️ **How it works:**

For any medium/high-risk orders, email the customer and ask them to verify the number code that shows up on their bank statement. In the example above, the customer would have to provide the code: 8426. Place this order on hold until they verify your unique 4-digit code.

Most scammers will only have the stolen credit card details and will not have access to the cardholders' bank account to verify this code.

If they cannot verify this 4-digit code even after you help them locate it, then simply cancel the order.

If the customer provides this 4-digit code and still opens a chargeback after processing their order, then it is very likely that you will win as long as you provide the bank with all of the evidence.

&#x200B;

**✅️ Use cases**

1. Medium-risk orders
2. High-risk orders
3. Multiple payment attempts
4. The billing address doesn't match the credit card details
5. The customer is shipping to another address with a different name
6. High-value orders
7. High-risk internet proxy used to place the order
8. The cardholder's name provided does not match the name on the shipping address"
shopify,Who else is testing TikTok Shop?,2023-10-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/17g9fdy/who_else_is_testing_tiktok_shop/,18,Recently launched a TikTok shop account for one of my e-commerce stores and have seen crazy results with very little effort. It was super easy to make the account and listings with the Shopify plugin. Looks like they are pushing posts with shops linked super hard right now. I've only done organic posts so far but i'll be testing ads running to a TikTok shop later this week. Is anyone else doing this right now? Let's talk about it. Seems like a rare opportunity that won't last for long.
shopify,One page checkout bugs,2023-10-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/17g7lh8/one_page_checkout_bugs/,29,"So this one page checkout is installed on my store like everyone else’s but Iv noticed ever since I got OPC my conversions went down a good bit, I’m still getting sales but not as much as I did before one page checkout. Originally I thought that it’s just a seasonal thing this time of year but Iv noticed other people saying the same thing. 

I have ran my own test orders and it does work fine for me but I still think my conversion rate decrease is due to OPC. I havnt had many people reaching out to me so I think they are just bouncing off my store. 

Also I have noticed that I can’t see as much abandoned carts either so can’t send cart recovery emails. This is so frustrating as I had a very good conversion before this OPC thing!

Has anyone else noticed this since implementing OPC"

shopify,Chargebacks and how to deal with them,2023-10-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/17gbw10/chargebacks_and_how_to_deal_with_them/,2,"Picture this: You run a thriving ecommerce store. Orders are coming in, customers are happy, and your products are flying off the shelves. You're on top of the world. Then, out of the blue, you receive... *a chargeback request*.

Chargebacks, those mysterious reversals of credit card charges, can feel like an unexpected storm in your otherwise sunny journey. Chargebacks are the equivalent of shoplifting in the digital space, you can't stop it, but you can protect yourself.

Let's look at what chargebacks are, how they happen and how you can respond.

## Understanding the Chargeback

In the world of ecommerce, a chargeback occurs when a customer disputes a transaction with their credit card company or bank. Chargebacks can be initiated for various reasons, such as unauthorized transactions, damaged goods, or billing errors.

In North America, chargebacks are handled by the bank that issued the card, not by your ecommerce platform, or your credit card gateway. When this happens, the funds from that sale (along with a chargeback fee) are immediately taken out of your account and returned to the customer.

Again, this is done by the bank, and by accepting credit cards, you're accepting the terms of the gateway which includes the ability for the bank to take back that money.

## What are the different Chargebacks?

There are different types of chargebacks that can be issued from a bank.

Common chargebacks include:

1. **Fraudulent Transaction:** If a customer spots unfamiliar or unauthorized charges on their credit card statement, they'll likely issue a chargeback. US Merchants can use [Fraud Protect](https://www.shopify.com/protect) to insure against these kinds of chargebacks. There's additional [third party apps](https://apps.shopify.com/categories/store-management-privacy-and-security-fraud) for this too.
2. **Product Not Received:** When the purchased item doesn't arrive or gets lost in transit, customers may opt for a chargeback. This type of chargeback will not be protected with Shopify Protect or third party apps.
3. **Not as Described:** If the received product significantly differs from what was advertised, frustration can lead to a chargeback.  This type of chargeback will not be protected with Shopify Protect or third party apps.

As mentioned, there are services that can help protect against the Fraudulent chargebacks. You'll need to decide as a business if a service like that would be required. [Signifyd](https://www.signifyd.com/solutions/complete-chargeback-protection/) has started offering coverage for non-fraud chargebacks as well.

For many merchants, it's more cost effective to eat a few chargebacks a year than to employ a service, but this is a business-by-business kind of decision.

## Responding to a Chargeback on Shopify

So, what happens when you receive a chargeback notification on your Shopify store? Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Review the Notification:** Take a deep breath, and carefully review the chargeback notification. Shopify will provide you with all the details you need.
2. **Gather Evidence:** Collect all evidence related to the transaction. This could include tracking information, customer correspondence, and order details.
3. **Submit a Response:** Within Shopify, submit your response along with the gathered evidence. Be thorough and transparent. View Shopify [Chargeback Response Form](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1768/5143/files/content-chargeback-response-form.jpg?v=1694016841) to see what all you can provide.
4. **Await Resolution:** The credit card company will assess the information from both sides and make a decision. This can take some time, so be patient (sometimes 90-120 days).

If you're getting chargebacks regularly, it's important to review the chargebacks in detail and see where you may be able to prevent more in the future.

For instances, if you're getting a lot of chargebacks for things like ""Product not as described"" perhaps you should look at updating your product photos and descriptions to be clearer and more aligned with the products.

## Protecting Yourself

Chargebacks can impact your business's reputation and finances, but there are ways to help protect yourself:

1. **Awesome Customer Service:** Clear communication and exceptional service can prevent many chargebacks.
2. **Accurate Product Descriptions:** Ensure your product listings accurately represent what customers will receive.
3. **Transparent Policies:** Have easy-to-find, transparent policies for refunds, returns, and where to contact you.
4. **Record-Keeping:** Keep detailed records of all transactions, communications, and shipments.

As mentioned, you can't stop Chargebacks, all we can do is be vigilant in protecting ourselves and have an action plan for what to do when they happen.

## Don't Capture Payment

An option for protection that many do not consider, is not capturing payment at checkout. You can simply authorize a transaction and then capture payment on fulfillment.

This allows you to easily cancel an order before fulfillment without worry of a chargeback (you can't do a chargeback if money hasn't been taken). You can also [automate a risk process](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shopify-flow/reference/examples#risk) with Shopify Flow!

You can even go as far as auto-capturing payment from repeat customers that you trust already. You can setup a Customer Tag for return customers, and then use Flow to check for that tag before taking any action. 

If it's a customer with the tag, let the order go through. If there's no tag, or the order is labeled High Risk, then don't capture payment (you could even auto-cancel the order if you wanted). 

There's a number of options for automation with [Shopify Flow](https://apps.shopify.com/flow) that can help you.

## What If I Lose?

That can happen, even if you're in the right! Wait... what??

That's right. The bank that issued the credit card makes the final decision and it is final. There are no dispute processes for merchants who lose the chargeback. 

Banks tend to side with their customers, particularly if they don't have a habit of issuing chargebacks. Unfortunately, this can hurt small businesses, and the process needs to be overhauled. 

Because there is no dispute process, if it's a large chargeback you may want to look at small claims court to get your money back. If you've got good evidence against them, there's a chance the court would side with you. The downside is, if the customer isn't in your area, the legal process can quickly get messy (and costly).

Hopefully you won't have to deal with chargebacks like that, but know that there are still options if you lose, they're just not great.

## Conclusion

In the world of ecommerce, chargebacks are a reality, but they don't have to be a mystery. Understanding why they happen, how to respond, and the steps to protect your business can help you navigate these stormy waters with confidence.

Remember, chargebacks are a learning opportunity. By approaching them with professionalism and empathy, you can maintain your success and keep happy customers."

shopifyappstore,Updates To EasyRoutes Local Delivery App - September 2023,2023-10-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/shopifyappstore/comments/16y1ok6/updates_to_easyroutes_local_delivery_app/,0,"Here's some updates we've made in the past month to EasyRoutes & the EasyRoutes Delivery Driver app:

https://preview.redd.it/jxdvrhz1jtrb1.png?width=1858&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e9d720274c36200fd5c7a26245a1b0a597c092a

**🎛️ New Feature: EasyRoutes Dashboard**

Opening EasyRoutes now lands on the Dashboard, providing quick access to common actions and a summary of your recent EasyRoutes activity.  Complete the setup guide, create empty routes, access your orders, and view recently created or completed routes - all from one convenient landing page:

https://preview.redd.it/j942wk83jtrb1.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c5f029fd4aac79f05f9c42fe9ce207c06a69fd2

Stay tuned for future updates to the Dashboard as we add more information and shortcuts to help streamline your deliveries!

&#x200B;

**☕️ New Route Option: Driver Breaks**

We've added a new route option that allows you to schedule custom blocks of time for your drivers to take a break between delivery stops:

https://preview.redd.it/9p9dftb4jtrb1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=b48f17a22c05a1ffca7fb592be647dcd49731a57

Driver breaks can be enabled or disabled from the [Route Options](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) page for new and existing routes. Route Scheduling must also be enabled in order to properly assign a time slot for driver breaks.

**Note**: Drivers will need to update to the latest version (1.0.29 or above) of the [EasyRoutes Delivery Driver App](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) in order to view breaks within their routes. 

&#x200B;

**🛒 Orders Page Updates**

We've updated the Orders page and Add Orders tab to speed up route creation and provide more details at a glance.  When any orders are selected, the **Add orders to map** button now remains visible on screen, floating in the same position as you scroll through the page:

https://preview.redd.it/td2vz0l5jtrb1.png?width=2006&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1f48f53a0305011f754b1492012ee7c413852b5

Once an order has been added to the map, its checkbox will convert into a green checkmark, like #1020 shown below. Hovering over the green checkmark will change it into a delete icon, like #1021 shown below; click this to remove the stop from the map:

https://preview.redd.it/li3zgjh6jtrb1.png?width=1638&format=png&auto=webp&s=9155baf21f599a64476e438bcc8287810b23f16a

Missing an order? Scroll to the bottom of the orders table to identify how many orders were fetched based on any applied [filters](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/). Click the time period to jump to your EasyRoutes settings and adjust how far back orders should be fetched from:

https://preview.redd.it/del6r6i7jtrb1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=2147fb510c1863e30d8ff54cd59ded3a98d11ddd

For completed routes or routes in progress, we've added a series of icons under the **Proof** column for each stop to indicate which Proof of Delivery items have been captured:

https://preview.redd.it/0qp2ead8jtrb1.png?width=2764&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e98751466af16de2157ad204f4272d18dbaa644

Click on any available icon to open the Proof of Delivery panel and view photos, eSignatures, driver notes and GPS delivery locations attached by your driver.

&#x200B;

**📖 Improvements to Address Book & Order Imports**

We've adjusted the Address book to simplify order import and saved stop workflows. You can now click the dropdown arrow next to the Address book button and click **Import and add orders** to bypass the Address book panel and jump directly to the Import CSV page:

https://preview.redd.it/enzjdie9jtrb1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=c01ab51ed3bc93bee128da40cb4fd82da202c24c

Once your CSV file has been processed, you can now opt to **Import and add stops to map** to complete your import and add all stops directly to the map:

https://preview.redd.it/cz1hzkiajtrb1.png?width=1652&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aae91028eeecd36f94af6153b4c0d7372fb408c

Imported custom stops also now contain three additional data variables: **Time window**, **Stop time**, and **Stop note.** All three of these variables are saved in the Address book entry for a stop, and will persist for any future routes that include this stop.  


**📱 EasyRoutes Delivery Driver 1.0.29**

EasyRoutes Delivery Driver has been updated to version 1.0.29, featuring support for the new driver breaks feature, enhancements for manual geocoding, and improvements to items & fulfillment workflows. The update also includes various UI improvements and bug fixes, and further enhances device authentication and user login on both the iOS & Android versions of the EasyRoutes Delivery Driver app.

We hope this latest round of updates helps make your deliveries even easier on Shopify!"

I am also researching this issue.

In my role involving interactions with store owners and management, I have examined several stores and identified two common situations:

Firstly, some stores are not using any apps or not using enough necessary apps to establish credibility and professionalism. These stores often appear dull unless they have exceptionally beautiful and captivating designs.

Secondly, there are stores that use too many support tools without careful selection. They have constant pop-ups, multiple unused apps, subscription boxes, live chat, and more. In my opinion, using too many apps can make a store cluttered and chaotic, causing discomfort for customers and reducing the likelihood of return visits, thus hindering the purchasing process.

These are my general observations, but I have yet to find a solution to this problem and have a few questions:

\- How many apps are sufficient for a store?

\- Which apps are necessary for a new store?

\- How can apps be effectively utilized to achieve the same goal: increase revenue and minimize costs for the store?

I am currently struggling with this issue and would appreciate your insights and opinions..."

shopifyappstore,Updates To EasyRoutes Local Delivery App - August 2023,2023-09-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/shopifyappstore/comments/16dj7zu/updates_to_easyroutes_local_delivery_app_august/,0,"Here's some updates we've made in the past month to EasyRoutes & the EasyRoutes Delivery Driver app:

https://preview.redd.it/06bdkk9wx2nb1.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea7361ed27b356362e3964d811a58d71712dc03d

**📖 New Feature: Address Book**

The [address book](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) lets you manage your frequently used custom stops in EasyRoutes. Create address book entries with customer names, addresses, and manual items and you'll be able to easily add them to your new and existing routes.

The address book is accessible for planning new routes from the main **Orders** screen, as well as the **Add orders** tabs on Route and Group pages to add to your existing routes:  


https://preview.redd.it/u5g8fxx8y2nb1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=61a8f929f76c25a73eade2bf503b49842f7d56f8

Within the address book dialog, you can add and edit entries, then use the checkbox(es) to select one or more and add to your route.

💡 **Pro-tip:** Frequently used address book entries can be pinned to the top of the address book by clicking the star icon to the left of an entry's name.  If you have an address book with many entries, use the search bar to find exactly what you need.  


**💾 Updates to CSV Import Workflows**

We've relocated the **Import CSV** button and all associated functionality into the **Import history** tab of the new address book feature.

From the address book panel you can import new CSV files containing custom stop data, and view any previous CSV imports and the stop data they contain:

https://preview.redd.it/rce0yncay2nb1.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=787d11166ac40a9fd47a5d2b12fd2e353d44d2b4

For more detailed information on CSV file formatting and importing custom stop data into EasyRoutes using the [address book](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/), check out this [support article](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/).  


**🗓️ Improvements to Partial & Scheduled Fulfillments**

We've increased the level of detail and user control for orders and stops that have partial fulfillments, which can be particularly useful for orders that ship from different warehouse locations, or scheduled fulfillments (such as subscription orders) that will be delivered on any future date(s). 

Once a route is created with a stop that contains a partial fulfillment, from the route page, all fulfilled and unfulfilled items included in that stop can be viewed by clicking the dropdown arrow in the Items column for that stop:

https://preview.redd.it/tzzdpwqby2nb1.png?width=2386&format=png&auto=webp&s=2253df1112a1efc38fe66b5bb5465324a0508f8e

By clicking Actions > Edit stop and scrolling down to the stop's Advanced options settings, you can see which portion(s) of the order have already been fulfilled, and select any/all remaining items to be included in this stop's current fulfillment. You can also view each item's fulfillment location to determine which warehouse location the items are shipping from:

https://preview.redd.it/6up30d1dy2nb1.png?width=1252&format=png&auto=webp&s=542f6db9f07a37c367c5bc34dff729f3c5713501

Once the stop has been fulfilled (depending on your [EasyRoutes fulfillment settings](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/), this may be manually triggered, or when a particular delivery status is applied to the order) the order page will now display any remaining unfilfilled items, and a breakdown of each past fulfillment, which items they contained, and which location they were fulfilled from:

https://preview.redd.it/5vhpnwkey2nb1.png?width=1302&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9ada48babaeb300736eac88007401f9d86162c7

**⚠️ Address Accuracy Warning**

We've added a warning message when EasyRoutes is unable to find an exact match for a stop's address, often due to a typo or incorrect information entered in a customer's address field(s).

When applicable, the warning will display as a bubble on the stop's entry within a route, and as a banner at the top of the stop's Edit Stop page.

**📱 EasyRoutes Delivery Driver 1.0.28**

EasyRoutes Delivery Driver has been updated to version 1.0.28 with various improvements and bug fixes. You can now require drivers using the app to add a note before they are able to mark an order as delivered.  We've also improved iOS support for navigating with Google Maps when offline or experiencing limited network connectivity, and enhanced device authentication and user login on both the iOS & Android versions of the EasyRoutes Delivery Driver app.  


**Other product updates**   
***(👀 there's some good stuff in here!)***

Here are more improvements that we've made to EasyRoutes:

* Filter by orders that have an “On Hold” fulfillment status
* Select all routes for exporting data
* 5-digit ZIP code filters now include 9-digit ZIP code results
* Improved UI for time windows on a route (e.g. see when time windows are not being used)
* Improved [time zone](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) support to allow users to see a route's ETAs by the scheduled route’s time zone
* Exporting stops now optionally includes the end location, when present
* Ability to set a default sort option and direction for the Routes page

Dispatch messages are now delivered via push notifications when sharing a route for a better and more reliable experience, and URLs shared in notes can be opened as links in the browser for sharing information with your drivers.

We've removed the Edit button when viewing a route. You can still edit your routes the same way you used to, but you don't have to click a button to enter edit mode first now!

## Other Product Updates (👀 there's some good stuff in here!)

Here are more improvements that we've made to EasyRoutes:

* Packing Lists: added settings to display the total count of items and total price for the order on packing slips, along with new options for where to display any notes.
* Tracking Pages: added the ability to hide timestamps and show only dates.
* You can now include non-shippable items in EasyRoutes. Check ""Include non-shippable items"" under Settings -> General -> Fulfillment items
* We've made it easier to update orders on a route before fulfilling or dispatching
* Filter orders by state or city
* Filter orders by custom order date ranges, and by orders that do not have a collected delivery date in the Delivery Date filter
* Improvements to filtering orders by tags (can now include **and** exclude by tags)
* Order dates for imported orders are now better supported
* Various bug fixes and usability improvements

I have banner images from our old website but they don’t stretch across the screen, not without editing coding. We figured out how to make it stretch across a desktop size, but then it messes up in mobile mode. Is there an app that will automatically size a banner image to the screen?

FulfillmentByAmazon,3 ways joining the Discord helped my FBA journey.,2022-07-14,https://www.reddit.com/r/FulfillmentByAmazon/comments/vyelj4/3_ways_joining_the_discord_helped_my_fba_journey/,33,"Hi everyone, I started my FBA business in December of 2020. It's a small but growing health and beauty brand, roughly $125k revenue in the trailing twelve months.

Joining the AmazonFBA Discord was one of the better decisions I've made, and I invite you to consider joining as well as it's a valuable resource for me. Here are my top three reasons you should join:

1. **The community**. My friends and family don't sell on Amazon or do e-commerce and I felt for a long time the desire to have community that is dedicated to the same thing I'm working on. The Discord gives me that. It's weird (maybe a little sad LOL) but I consider some of the members there to be my friends. 
2. **Direct/Point Blank Feedback**. Let's face it. This industry has a lot of passersby who are curious but don't actually intend on doing the work. This has caused Amazon Sellers to be very direct in their advice and feedback. This can be very beneficial. If you've done the research and have a creative question, you will receive direct but valuable feedback.
3. **Fast, Passive Learning**. I don't always read every thread, but will often skim through them just to catch up - as oftentimes it's entertaining as well (Sellers are funny). Doing this consistently has increased my FBA (and business) knowledge quite a bit. I now know little things about patent infringement, injection/composite molds, dealing with manufacturers, etc. that I didn't know before. It helps me plan out my path forward.

So I invite you to join us. Here is a link: [https://discord.gg/VcRZTsS](https://discord.gg/VcRZTsS)"
FulfillmentByAmazon,Amazon compliant packaging - liquids,2023-10-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/FulfillmentByAmazon/comments/17gdimr/amazon_compliant_packaging_liquids/,2,"Hey y'all, I was wondering if anyone has experience shipping liquid product to Amazon. We're working on improving our packaging and production processes, and trying to move away from poly-bags if possible (we're a sustainable company).

Our products are classified as non-dangerous and ship in an aluminum bottle, therefore, we should be able to skip poly-bagging so long as we have a 'double seal'. Amazon defines a double seal as: a tightened lid that cannot easily be opened and one of the following: induction seal, safety ring, clips, plastic wrap band.

My question is if anyone knows whether a tamper-evident band would be considered a safety ring (think twist-off aluminum caps on a metal beverage bottle). 

Or, if anyone knows how to contact a department that can confirm for us if this will work (Seller Support hasn't been helpful yet).

Thanks!

He will return all the products damaged (might be hard though since they live in china) 2. Theyll keep it on pending. Is there anyway i can cancel this order?"

I get it, its not overnight and there is work to be had but unlike most people looking for a get rich quick I am here for the long haul and I have seen success with FBA despite all the trends of side hustles.  I know the pandemic and being locked at home really boosted the online shopping model and what research I have done there is no slowing down for the next 5 10 years, in fact it shows exponential growth.  Again I did look into amazon years ago and thought it was bogus.. but best time to plant a tree was 25 years ago, second best time is now.  with that said:  anyone that is a noob to a pro vet, what are some: 

* **pros**
* **cons**
* **advice**

* **things you have learned**
* **things you wish you knew**

FulfillmentByAmazon,Any Tips/Advice before I request a chargeback? (Canada),2023-10-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/FulfillmentByAmazon/comments/17g6tmc/any_tipsadvice_before_i_request_a_chargeback/,2," 

I have dealt with this supplier (clothing) from China for 5 years, probably have ordered around $50-60K from them worth of product (CAD). Always paying through Ali-Baba after order is made on WhatsApp. My last order was made and paid for about 7 weeks ago. Product takes about 2 months to arrive. The tracking # said delivered (UPS, 7 boxes), and all 7 were delivered to an address in the complete wrong city. UPS states that this was the address given to them, supplier via dispute/WhatsApp chat first claimed that it was indeed the wrong address, then says its simply a UPS issue. Anyone can track it on UPS website, the address given by the supplier that he shipped to is wrong that the city/address on UPS official website tracking. Ali-Baba dispute center is not helping, stating that on ""their end"" it is correct and delivered. I did not receive the package. 1000% CLEAR EVIDENCE, like... CLEAR AS DAY it is not delivered to myself.

I have PC Financial credit card, I called them briefly yesterday to ask them for their opinion, and they suggest that once the dispute window closes, to file a claim/chargeback if there is no resolution. I have never done anything like this before. Any tips? I really needed this product and I would prefer it versus the refund but I clearly need a new supplier... 5 years of business and now they speak broken English and do not want to assist. The address it was delivered to is an Amazon Fulfillment office in Brampton ONTARIO which is 5 hours from me with ZERO methods of contact. UPS states that the product that was shipped via this tracking number was not what I am stating it is. (I ordered clothing, they are saying that the 7 boxes are labeled under hand bags).

I am just lost for words, was around $4000 CAD in product/fees. I thought AliBaba was a BILLION dollar company and was reputable, the dispute interactions with the AliBaba reps was HORRID!"
FulfillmentByAmazon,GTIN not recognized by Amazon,2023-10-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/FulfillmentByAmazon/comments/17gad5q/gtin_not_recognized_by_amazon/,4,"Hey everyone, I am new to FBA, have started production on my product in China, and for the last week have been working on getting my listing ready, but keep running into the same problem. Amazon Support has no been of any help so far, and searching google and this sub hasn't given me any real answers either. So in a last ditch effort, here I am.

I purchased my GTINs from the official GS1us website a week ago. When going through the steps of adding my product to Amazon, the only issue I have run into is that I get the frustrating ""The SKU does not match any ASIN and contains invalid value(s) for attributes required for creation of a new ASIN."" error message under External Product ID and External Product ID Type for each of my two (size) variations.

The first time I reached out to support, they had me send screenshots from the GS1us website to prove that the GTINs existed, then closed the ticket after basically saying ""okay, try again"".

The second time I reached out, they provided instructions on how to add a product via uploading an excel sheet. This time, when I upload, I get the same few error messages all saying something similar to ""There is no record of the SKU corresponding to this update on your account. This commonly occurs when there are other issues on your SKU."" then referring me to the Impacted Cells (C4, C5), which are for Brand Name, not SKU.

Also worth noting is that I have my own brand name. I do not know how to register it with Amazon or if I even need to. I created my own SKUs that I filled in the corresponding cells with. I was under the impression that SKUs are company-internal, so I can basically make it anything I want, which I did, so I don't understand why Amazon is saying it's not in their system. Of course it's not, I haven't been able to add them because you keep blocking me from doing it. So I'm totally lost on that part. 

It's been a vicious cycle of ""Your SKU isn't in our system, so we can't add your product, but you need to give us your SKU so you can add your product to our system, but we don't recognize your SKU so we can't add your product..."" What am I doing wrong?

I have tried selecting ""This product does not have a brand name"" but still receive the error message.

And when using the Via Upload method, there is no option to select ""This product does not have a brand name"" and the Brand Name cell is required, so I am not able to use this option this way.

Like I said, Amazon Support is useless so I am relying on you guys. Please, I cannot be the only one this has happened to. My products will be ready for pick up in 5 days and I do not have my listing ready, thus no addresses to send my products to when they're ready. If anyone has any other ideas that I have not tried, I am willing to try anything at this point. "
AmazonSeller,/r/AmazonSeller - sub rules and wiki page updates,2021-09-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonSeller/comments/pro3uc/ramazonseller_sub_rules_and_wiki_page_updates/,3,"Hi,

thank you for participating in the /r/AmazonSeller subreddit. 

**NOTE:** This forum is neither run / moderated by Amazon employees, nor is there any guarantee that an Amazon employee will come to the sub, see your participation, and respond to it. **If you wish to discuss something with Amazon, then you should contact them through their site**

# A *caution* for all sub participants

First and foremost, an important reminder for all of you

We don't want you to get burned. ***This sub like ALL ecommerce forums is under a constant barrage from scammers / spammers / promoters / info farmers***.  Though we remove a large portion of it, some of these clowns do get through. No matter your skillset and experience, the following kinds of situations should set off red flags every time;

* contact me / send me / sharing / let's talk in private requests.  This is an attempt to scam you in private.  If they can't say it out in the open, don't trust them
* the SUPER helpful guru - especially the ones claiming to know everything and make so much money that someone actually in their position in the real world would never have the time for what they are doing here.  No actual millionaire is here seeking a buddy just like you to give all their secrets to. 
* people who have magical paid groups for ""secret sharing"" and paid courses with all the answers.  It's like throwing money in a trash can.
* anyone trying to reach you for interaction beyond this forum and has no physical contact info or tries to put hurdles in the way of actual IRL contact

These scenarios are more often an attempt to draw you in by someone lead generating for a service, info farming, or a scam.  Especially if you are new to selling or social media, your info and money are their goal so *be on your guard*.

If the people who participate in this sub are the target market for you / your business, then take this rule seriously. Promotion violations will result in a permanent ban. There are no exceptions and appeals are not allowed

   **---> If you are an Amazon VA / Consultant, tread carefully in this sub**.  *Understand this is NOT the place to try to generate leads via any method, overt or implied.  You WILL be banned for it.* **<---**

* **3) No Amazon policy violation discussion** - You may not discuss intentionally breaking Amazon's system or intentional violation of their terms. This also includes anything which can be deemed as deceptive.

   *Note: Discussion of reviews is restricted* due to multiple issues; the topic has already been extensively covered, the frequency of deception, dishonesty and other forms of bad faith involved, the high amount of Amazon TOS violation discussion within these posts, and the constant targeting of this topic by bad actors for spamming, promoting, lead generating, and scamming purposes. Refer to [the Amazon Seller Product Reviews Policies page](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/YRKB5RU3FS5TURN) where the majority of questions on this topic are readily covered

   * No tracking links of any kind

* **5) Posting and commenting restrictions** - *Account age, prior account activity with positive comment karma, and prior participation in the comments here are all required to post in this subreddit*. Problem posts most often come from new account holders unaware of the rules OR scammers / spammers. Participate in the comments until you can post. Negative karma accounts may not post or comment here. Requesting exceptions or appeals may result in a ban.

# Wiki Page Updates

### [**The AmazonSeller Resource Wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonSeller/wiki/resources)

The resource post has been moved to a wiki page.  A link to this wiki will be added to pinned posts and the sidebar.  We will post from time to time seeking suggestions for additions OR we may approve trusted sub participants to add info to the wiki (this would require a long participation history in this sub without rule violations)

### [**Ban Appeal Info Page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonSeller/wiki/rulesbansappeals)

If you have been banned, you need to read this wiki page BEFORE you appeal.  It covers how to appeal, how not to appeal and what to avoid, when you can appeal, and includes links to info relevant to bans.

Thank you

Ad budget had been $20 but just lowered it to $10. On only automatic. Only 1 return. 

Question is, do I need to just keep taking the L and keep up the ad spend which it keeps building momentum? Or can I cut back to wait if this thing is gonna work? 

Hard to watch all the money go to AMZ when I haven’t even gotten a cent (actually paid them) and I still haven’t covered product costs.

AmazonFBAOnlineRetail,Resource list for Amazon Sellers.,2023-07-23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFBAOnlineRetail/comments/157j0l4/resource_list_for_amazon_sellers/,6,"Succeeding in FBA can be quite hard in a competitive market like this.

And with the lack of Resources out there, its easy to make a mistake (while choosing a product, choosing a supplier, etc.), and mistake is something you can not Afford, especially in a high-ticket business like Amazon FBA.

So I decided to Compile a list of helpful Resources/Groups/Communities that new Amazon Seller can refer to:

# 1. Amazon Seller Central

You might already know about this. Its a forum for Amazon Sellers, where you can ask about any Question you have.

If you have a query, you can try asking here.

But Its more or less like Reddit, sometimes your Questions can go unnoticed.

# 2. Twitter

Twitter is definitely the most helpful and reliable resource for any type of eCommerce.

Its also the easiest way to find suppliers, dealers, leads, etc.

I myself found my current supplier through Twitter, I was interacting with other seller on twitter, and someone recommended them.

# 3. [The FBA Roadmap](https://gumroad.com/a/588523731/mrlfoy)

https://preview.redd.it/afmcnyrkpqdb1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1acc56362408e698697346f28c995e6200b09d9

This is a HUGE Amazon Seller Community created by fellow Sellers from Reddit & Twitter.

Its also has a complete step-by-step Guide to Selling on Amazon + a closed Discord Community of over **45000 Amazon Sellers** who can help you with your queries if needed.

https://preview.redd.it/jukob09mpqdb1.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=224830dab9a6970c7824b3bfbbcae48f8e8618b7

You can [find more about it here](https://gumroad.com/a/588523731/mrlfoy)

# 4. Helium10

https://preview.redd.it/a5mhnkhnpqdb1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fd58a2c86a71da5900fccabc47e34ad5634d577

Helium10 is known for its collection of tools helpful to Amazon Sellers. They have many free tools like Keyword Research, PPC audit, Sales Estimator, etc.

What I like most is their Free Keyword tool, helps in finding low competition keywords.

Keyword Research is an important step if you to make sure that your product ranks higher in Amazon Search. It can boost your product ranking by a lot if done right.

# 5. Google Trends

https://preview.redd.it/tq5d0blopqdb1.png?width=1407&format=png&auto=webp&s=a89c9f4e4392c6bd3792db3219fccc5727056034

Google Trends can be a really helpful resource for finding trending products.

It can provide you info about all the current Trends in the market and show you what most people are searching on Google right now.

You can use this info and choose your next product according to the Market Demand.

In other words, you can use this tool to basically *cash out the hype.*

# 6. FBA Hustlers

Its a private Facebook group for Amazon Sellers. It has around 4000 Amazon Sellers. Its a decent place to talk to other sellers and get opinions / advice.

However the group has a really long approval time. I requested to join the group last month, and my request is not approved yet.

You can give it a try and see if you get accepted.

..............................

These were some Resources that I can think of rn.

Will definitely add few more to this list when I get time."

Just not profitable. Free shipping is nearly everywhere these days, I need to consider how others are charging too when buyers can look around too. 

If sourcing from Alibaba, together with the shipping cost to US, then there's Temu and other sellers selling similar or identical products, pricing for a profit just isn't as nice from seller's perspective."

FBAadvanced,New to FBA,2023-09-28,https://www.reddit.com/r/FBAadvanced/comments/16txd1k/new_to_fba/,0,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I am looking to source a product from Alibaba. I have found the supplier. I have discussed the pricing and shipping. I have calculated the profit, and everything seems to align.

&#x200B;

I have questions about creating a new product, Amazon warehouse, and distribution services, as well as how to add a product I don't have on hand. 

&#x200B;

Let me elaborate:

1. The product is chosen. All I need to figure out is my package's design and size. Most likely, it will be a large or oversized product. The product itself is pebble-like soil(not considered actual soil)
2. I do not understand how to calculate what I need to pay for storage and distribution services as I am still in talks with the supplier about sizing and package design. I do have a GTIN that will represent my product, but I cannot add images yet. I can not create and verify the brand with Amazon for my product either.
3. For the supplier to give me an accurate estimate for shipping, I need to give them the address of the distribution warehouse, but.... Amazon will not give me that until I verify my brand, upload my product, and give them all the other details.

If you have any suggestions or are willing to engage in a discussion, I would love to hear more from people who know what they are doing."
FBAadvanced,When is the best time to ship for Christmas?,2023-09-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/FBAadvanced/comments/16ag91n/when_is_the_best_time_to_ship_for_christmas/,0,"Hi guys  
Christmas is on December 25th, and Amazon’s cut-off date for receiving is around December 1-3. Although Amazon can still accept shipments after December 1st, you may miss some events. During the peak season, the shipping time may be 2-3 days slower. It is important to choose the right shipping method.

1. Express; 3－9days
2. Air: 9-12 days
3. Fastest sea: 18－25days
4. Normal sea: 35－50days (unstable)

If your budget is limited, only Normal sea can maximize your profit. Then the best shipping date is **mid-October**, or even earlier, because the Normal sea is unstable, which is beyond the control of the carrier. Of course, we will give professional advice on which shipping method to choose.   
In the peak season, many people will use the combination of Air and Sea.  


**Note: Time according to each shipping method above. We'd better arrange shipment 5-10 days in advance.**  


In addition, we must always remind suppliers to complete the product within the specified time during the production stage. During peak seasons, production delays often occur. It makes you have to choose a faster shipping method to increase the cost. Therefore, please place an order from the supplier in advance, and follow up with the supplier for production.  


**Some causes of delays you need to know:**  
1. Production order overload causes delays  
2. Quality inspection failed  
3. Container space is limited. The cut-off time is advanced.  
4. Port workloads up, workforce down (strikes)  
5. Amazon's warehouse is full, it‘s difficult to make delivery appointments  


If you don't want to miss Christmas,   
**September is a great time to place your order and October is a great time to ship.**  


Also, if you plan for Black Friday too. Then arrange shipping in September.

I’m finding Santrel Media to be a bit more informative, they also aren’t trying to upsell anything which helps.

I use a personal app - that has limits though, even after being verified.

Western Union - they block your account if you send too much.

Send direct from bank? Which bank do you use?

What rates do you get? Have you compared with other platforms? Traditionally banks have poor rates."

ecommerce,"Q4 And Losing Millions Of $ In Potential Sales Due To Not Being Prepared ( Halloween, BCFM, Christmas) Experience.",2023-10-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/17goyic/q4_and_losing_millions_of_in_potential_sales_due/,0,"Greetings, fellow Redditors. 

The biggest sales period of the year is here. 

In this post, I will talk about preparation and why it's important.

I remember my first black Friday in 2018, just 3 days before we decided that we were going to launch a 60% discount for two days sitewide. 

I was super excited, I imagined the money just being printed straight into my wallet.

I felt like I was going to do the heist of the year. Everyone is buying.

Guess what? We did $48k in sales with 2 ROAS, and just like that, my dream of money being printed in my pocket was gone.

The funny thing is that a month before, we did the same in Halloween, whereas just 3 days before, we decided to offer 50% off sitewide, and we did $270k in sales.

So it was only reasonable that the same would happen for BFCM. 

This taught me a lesson like no other. 

First of all, success in Halloween was pretty much guaranteed since there weren't many brands advertising a crazy offer, and everyone was holding their best cards for Black Friday.

Advertising in Halloween was not the main lesson. 

The main lesson was preparing for black Friday.

And ever since that year, we started to plan black Friday in advance, in 2019, we started to plan black Friday in the 1st of November after making bank again from Halloween. 

This time it went a little better. $70k in sales.

I was pissed, wtf am I doing wrong. 

Okay, got it. Let's prepare sooner. 

In 2020 we prepared in black Friday in October. This is going to be it. 

We did close to a million in sales across multiple brands, had the opportunity to sell more but couldn't because of the lack of inventory.

2021, did the preparation in September hit $ 2 million in sales in Black Friday period. 

2022 started to prepare in September one but this time with all the lessons, hit $5 Million in sales in Black Friday period. 

Fast forward to 2023, we started to prepare in August. 

The faster we started to do the preparation work the better results we had.

Every year there was a new lesson. 

Here is our simple checklist.

1) Use the best-selling items for the whole year 
2) Do a quantity drop on Cyber Monday for your loyal customer list.
3) Use the best-performing creatives across the whole year and slap the black Friday sale on top of them
4) Advertise early access for Q4 offers and special gifts to the first customers
5) Inventory, this is actually number one on the list. Decide what you are going ot sell early. This time we started to make orders in July and for some brands as fast as June. 
6) Hire people in advance for packaging help
7) This is actually the first item on the list - do projections on how much do you want to sell in Q4 period.
8) Notify all advertising platforms of the budget you are planning to spend.
9) Launch the creatives in advance ( all of our black friday ads were launched in the beginning of October, they are just waiting to be turned on)
10) Have an alert ad account ready.
11) Notify your payment processor of the projected sales
12) Build out 2 different landing pages for Q4 to split test which ones convert better.
13) Prepare all of your black friday email series.
14) Create a special black Friday thank you flow with updates about your shipping process.
15) Tease on the black Friday countdown on your socials with start time, offers and so on.

There is even more. But this is the jist of it. 

The success of your Q4 sales is in preparation. 

Will do a case study of how much sales we generated this year.

We are ready to do the heist and print money.

Just like every year. :D

Pretty sure that this year will have its own lessons. 

Thanks for reading."
ecommerce,Best way to nurture/ convert ecom leads (quiz funnel),2023-10-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/17gjb0c/best_way_to_nurture_convert_ecom_leads_quiz_funnel/,0,"Hi r/ecommerce  
I run a specialized ecommerce website with a quiz funnel for personalized products. Potential customers will walk through the quiz funnel in order to see their personalized product page.  


At the end of the funnel visitors can enter their email address. This is not required, yet users are encouraged to do so in order to save their entered data. The opt in rate is fairly high (>70%).  
For the majority of leads who have not purchased, the email address and other data from the quiz funnel is available to further work with.

I've tested an email which is send 2 days after the quiz funnel submission with a 20% off coupon which has a poor conversion rate of just about 1%. Other than that there is no follow-up since I don't want to spam the leads.

  
On the product page itself I gathered some info with an exit intent popup asking why visitors wouldn't want to purchase the product. The majority says the price, others mention that they're unsure if they'll like the product. With this in mind I've also tested replacing the 20% off email with one that emhasizes the product quality.

  
I feel like there is a lot of potential for turning those leads into customers but I haven't really figured it out yet. An email drip campaign might be the right move but I'm unsure about that.

  
Do you have any recommendations, would you recommend going all in with a drip email campaign or other tools?

  
Thanks"

*""Warehouse information error: Your products couldn't be synced to TikTok due to a location address error. Update your location addresses on Shopify and try again.""*  
  
I've also received a similar error message when attempting to sync in TikTok Channel Overview that reads:  
  
*""Your products couldn't be synced to TikTok due to a location address issue. Update your location addresses on Shopify and try again.""*  
  
**Attempted Solutions Thus Far:** Found an article in Shopify forums for a ""work around"" that instructed to download Aftership app on Shopify. I did and it seemed to do nothing. I checked my addresses everywhere on both Shopify and TikTok Shop and all addresses match precisely. During my search I found a plethora of equality frustrated people but no other solution.  
  
From reading in both Shopify help and TikTok help I am wondering if each of my suppliers needs and address listed. However I am not sure if that is a solution. When I tried to do this to see if it was I was reminded that I am, in fact, NOT as technically savvy as I thought. I could not figure out how to add the damn addresses to these ""warehouses"" or what addresses to even put for them. Therefore I cannot confirm nor deny that this would be the solution. Finally, in a fit of frustration and demoralization I made this post here, hoping for a miracle.  
  
**Goal:** I simply want to get my TikTok shop and my Spotify shop connected so that I can start making videos and selling. Originally I had my Etsy connected to TikTok Shop but you can only have one store connected. My intent was to connect my Etsy to my Shopify and then my Shopify to TikTok. However, at this moment I would be ec-freakin-static if someone could just Captain Save-A Ho-me and either link to an article and/or post I may have missed explaining in detail how to fix this or provide a detailed solution in the comments. My friends, I am at your mercy. PLEASE help! Thank you kindly :)"

I’m going to be selling special occasion dresses through google ads.

I’m going to spend $1000 a month on google ads with an average $.50 cost per click. This will give me 2,000 clicks.

If I can convert 1% of them, that’s 20 sales.

20*250= 5,000 for the first month in gross profit.

With those numbers, I question what I’ve been doing with my life.  I can’t fathom that much money from an e-commerce store.

I recently launched a unique Shopify app designed to simplify the process for store owners interested in dropshipping a variety of health tests.  
We've hit a snag, though. The Shopify App Store's built-in advertising doesn't allow for geo-targeting, and we're getting clicks from countries like Japan and France, which doesn't help since our app is designed exclusively for the US market since all of our labs are in the US.  
I'm reaching out for advice: Are there any alternative marketing strategies or platforms you would recommend for targeting US-based Shopify stores? Your thoughts and suggestions would be invaluable as we navigate this challenge.

Thank you!"

It's easy to fall into the trap of emphasizing low Cost Per Purchase and high ROAS, especially when targeting existing customers. However, your real growth potential lies in expanding your customer base. Here's a breakdown of what to consider:

**1. Diversify Your Ad Strategy:** Balancing ads that target new and existing customers is key. Allocate a significant portion of your budget to acquire new customers and a smaller portion for retargeting existing ones.

**2. Analyze Key Metrics:** Keep a close eye on metrics like New Customer ROAS and Cost to Acquire New Customers. These numbers will guide your strategy and help you gauge the effectiveness of your ad spend.

**3. Email Marketing:** To retain existing customers, invest in email marketing. It's cost-effective and can boost customer loyalty and lifetime value.

**4. Regular Data Review:** Consistently review your ad data to adapt your strategy as needed. Don't get blinded by seemingly great CPA or ROAS figures; focus on the bigger picture.

**5. Communication with Agencies:** If you're working with an agency, clearly communicate your goals and the importance of new customer acquisition. Make sure they align with your growth strategy.

Remember, a well-balanced approach that prioritizes both new and existing customers will set you on a path to sustainable, long-term success."

LogisticsHub,Is the Freight Brokerage Bubble Bursting?,2023-10-19,https://www.reddit.com/r/LogisticsHub/comments/17bnrxl/is_the_freight_brokerage_bubble_bursting/,0,"Sources say that several midsize freight brokers are in financial trouble.  


This is due to many factors, including collapsing market fundamentals and overcapacity in the market.  


One of freight brokers' biggest challenges is the freight rate collapse. Spot and contract rates have been low all year, and there is no indication that they will improve anytime soon.  


This strains brokers' margins, and many struggle to make ends meet.  


Another challenge facing freight brokers is the overcapacity in the market. There are simply too many trucks chasing too few loads. This keeps rates low and makes it difficult for brokers to find profitable business.  


The combination of these factors is leading to several freight brokerages failing.  


This trend will likely continue as the freight market deteriorates in the coming months.  


What does this mean for you?  


If you are a shipper, you may be able to negotiate lower freight rates with your brokers. However, it is important to note that the quality of service may suffer as brokers consolidate and become more selective about the loads they accept.  


If you are a trucker, you may have to be more prepared to negotiate rates and be willing to take on less profitable loads. It is also important to have a good relationship with your broker so that they are more likely to give you priority when loads come in.  


If you are a freight broker, you need to be very careful about the business you accept. Be sure to vet your customers carefully and avoid working with shippers who are at risk of bankruptcy. You also need to be prepared to negotiate rates and offer flexible terms to your customers.  


The freight market is in a state of flux, and it is important to be aware of the latest trends. This will help you to make informed decisions about your business and protect your bottom line."

Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, and TikTok Shop are all major social media platforms that are investing in social commerce. They all offer features that allow businesses to sell products directly to their followers.  


Instagram is currently the leader in social commerce, with over 2 billion active users. It offers a variety of features that make it easy for businesses to sell products, such as Instagram Shopping, Instagram Stories, and Instagram Live Shopping.  


Pinterest is a newer player in social commerce, with over 450 million active users. It is a visual discovery platform that is well-suited for social commerce. Pinterest also offers a variety of features that make it easy for businesses to sell products, such as Buyable Pins, Pinterest Trends, and Pinterest Lens.  


TikTok Shop is also a new player in social commerce, with over 1 billion active users. It is known for its entertaining and engaging videos, and it allows users to buy products directly from TikTok videos.

Instagram: $50 billion  
Facebook: $30 billion  
Pinterest: $10 billion  
TikTok: $5 billion

Instagram has a large and engaged user base of millennials and Gen Z, who are the two generations most likely to shop online. Additionally, Instagram offers a variety of features that make it easy for businesses to sell products, such as Instagram Shopping, Instagram Stories, and Instagram Live Shopping.  


However, TikTok Shop has the potential to challenge Instagram for leadership in social commerce. TikTok Shop has a large and engaged user base of Gen Z, who are the most likely generation to shop online. Additionally, TikTok Shop offers a unique advantage in allowing users to buy products directly from TikTok videos."

LogisticsHub,Revenge Travel and the Slowing Economy: What It Means for Online Sales and 3PLs,2023-10-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/LogisticsHub/comments/178lrou/revenge_travel_and_the_slowing_economy_what_it/,0,"Revenge travel has been a major trend in the past year, as people have finally been able to take the vacations they had to put off during the pandemic.  


However, the current economic slowdown is starting to impact this trend.  


According to a recent survey by Deloitte, 40% of Americans plan to spend less on travel in the next year due to rising costs and inflation. This is bad news for online retailers, as travel is a major category of online spending.  


In addition, the economic slowdown is also impacting the supply chain, which is making it more difficult and expensive for online retailers to get their products to customers. This could lead to longer shipping times and higher shipping costs, which could further deter consumers from shopping online.  


So, what does this mean for 3PLs?  


On the one hand, the slowdown in online sales could lead to decreased demand for 3PL services. However, on the other hand, 3PLs could play a vital role in helping online retailers reduce costs and improve efficiency.  


For example, 3PLs can help online retailers consolidate their inventory into fewer warehouses, saving money on rent and logistics costs. Additionally, 3PLs can help online retailers optimize their shipping routes and delivery methods, saving money and reducing shipping times.  


3PLs are well-positioned to help online retailers weather the storm and come out stronger on the other side.  


Here are some specific ways that 3PLs can help online retailers during the economic slowdown:  


\- Consolidated inventory: 3PLs can help online retailers consolidate their inventory into fewer warehouses, saving money on rent and logistics costs.  
\- Optimized shipping: 3PLs can help online retailers optimize their shipping routes and delivery methods, saving money and reducing shipping times.  
\- Reduced costs: 3PLs can help online retailers reduce their overall costs by offering various competitive services.  
\- Improved efficiency: 3PLs can help online retailers improve their efficiency by automating tasks and streamlining processes.  
\- Scalability: 3PLs can help online retailers scale their businesses up or down as needed without investing in additional infrastructure or staff.  


By working with a 3PL, online retailers can focus on their core business of selling products and let the 3PL handle the logistics. This can free up time and resources that can be used to grow the business."

#I. Introduction

##Definition of Dropshipping
A method of retail sales where the store does not maintain a physical inventory of products in stock but instead purchases the item from a third-party (typically the manufacturer or wholesaler) every time they make a sale and have the third-party ship it directly to the end consumer.

##The First Sale Doctrine and Dropshipping
The First Sale Doctrine is a USA legal principle that allows the buyers of a product to resell that product no matter what the copyright holder desires. This is incredibly important for dropshippers to understand.

From the Justice.gov website: ""The first sale doctrine, codified at 17 U.S.C. § 109, provides that an individual who knowingly purchases a copy of a copyrighted work from the copyright holder receives the right to sell, display or otherwise dispose of that particular copy, notwithstanding the interests of the copyright owner. The right to distribute ends, however, once the owner has sold that particular copy. See 17 U.S.C. § 109(a) & (c). Since the first sale doctrine never protects a defendant who makes unauthorized reproductions of a copyrighted work, the first sale doctrine cannot be a successful defense in cases that allege infringing reproduction."" 

read more here: https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1854-copyright-infringement-first-sale-doctrine

In essence the First Sale Doctrine allows the owner of a legally-purchased copy of a copyrighted item to sell or transfer that particular copy without obtaining permission from the copyright holder. This means that once a person lawfully purchases a copyrighted product, they have the right to resell it without infringing on the copyright owner's exclusive rights. You've seen this at resale shops, garage sales, online auctions, etc...

In the context of dropshipping, the First Sale Doctrine can be relevant because it allows dropshippers to sell products that they have legally acquired from a supplier without obtaining permission from the copyright holder. As long as the dropshipper has legally purchased the products and the products are genuine, they can be resold without infringing on the copyright owner's exclusive rights.

However, it's important to note that the First Sale Doctrine has its limitations. For example, it doesn't protect dropshippers who sell counterfeit or pirated products. If a dropshipper sells counterfeit or pirated products, they could still face legal action from the copyright owner. Copyright owners might also try and limit the usage of their copyrighted works from unauthorized dropshippers including photography, video, marketing materials, and other copyrighted works related to the product being sold.

In addition, some copyright owners may try to limit the application of the First Sale Doctrine by imposing restrictions on the resale of their products. For example, some software manufacturers include license agreements that prohibit the resale of their products. In these cases, dropshippers would need to comply with the terms of the license agreement or risk infringing on the copyright owner's exclusive rights.

When starting your dropshipping venture the First Sale Doctrine can be an important legal principle for you to understand and navigate, as it can impact your ability to sell certain products without infringing on the copyright owner's exclusive rights. 

**Example in the Wild:**  
There's an example out of Texas where an entrepreneur started selling products from the gas station Buc-ee's who does not have their own online store. Buc-ee's can't stop the resale, but they were able to request that the seller change the name of the store so that it did not confuse consumers that the store might be official. That entrepreneur visits their local Buc-ee's once per week, takes photos, selects new products to sell, and charges a fee to buyers for their efforts. *(note: This isn't exactly dropshipping since the merchant buys the product at retail then ships it themselves. It is merely an example of the First Sale Doctrine being applied currently)*

##Types of Dropshipping  
There are a lot of different configurations that all fall under the umbrella of 'dropshipping'. Here we are just trying to give you some basic descriptions of some of the main ones:  

* **Classic Dropshipping** - Simple enough, you sell a product at markup and order it from the manufacturer/wholesaler and they ship it to your customer for you. Most often this is done via ecommerce and is designed so the company has almost zero overhead outside of marketing materials.   
* **Print on Demand Dropshipping** - In this configuration a garment / object printing company uses expensive direct to product printing machines to print orders but also keeps the garments / objects in stock, ships them out on your behalf, and may also offer automation to keep your website / storefront updated.  *Note: this might also include a 3d-printing company or waterjet company*
* **Private-Label Dropshipping** - This is where a product is produced when your order comes in then packaged in a type of packaging you specify and your label added to the packaging before being shipped to your customer on your behalf.   
* **Retail Extension Dropshipping** - In this configuration a dropshipping merchant partners with a brick and mortar store that has no desire to run an online operation. They make a custom deal with this store and then sell their products online at a markup. When a sale comes through, the retail store fulfills it.  
* **Product Creation Dropshipping** - This is where a merchant might bundle products or pieces from the inventory of a supplier to create an entirely new product, sell that product via their website, and then have all of the pieces shipped out by the supplier to the customer. This is extremely rare.   
* **Virtual Kitchen Dropshipping** - In this configuration a local virtual kitchen is used to create food orders on-demand for your customers based on a recipe you create. The food is then typically also shipped/delivered by the kitchen or a delivery company they or you have an agreement with.   
* **Showroom Dropshipping** - In this type of Dropshipping, often referred to as ""Factory Direct"", a physical retail showroom is built where consumers can touch and feel examples of merchandise, but the merchant orders the product directly from the manufacturer instead of selling the floor model or a model from their own warehouse. This has become extremely common with furniture retail allowing smaller furniture stores to sell more inventory and have far lower overhead. Some argue this is not exactly dropshipping since the merchant sometimes has to purchase a small amount of inventory and sometime sells the floor model (especially when it is outdated). This is unlikely a good fit for a first time dropshipper.   
* **Sales Rep Dropshipping** - Most frequently this is done using commissioned sales representatives who go door to door selling a product or selection of products. Once the order is received by the sales representative they hand it off to a fulfillment team who then order it from the supplier to be shipped. This type is cumbersome to get started but might fit in certain areas. For example Quill sends reps door to door in office buildings taking orders for office supplies, since they are owned by Staples the office supplies are then shipped from a nearby Staples retail store or warehouse. Quill is not a dropshipper, but the same tactic is applicable, with a similar markup scheme. Like Showroom Dropshipping this would require a tremendous amount of effort and is probably most often not worth it. While door to door is the main way this is/has been applied it could also be done via catalog or phone calls where a sales rep is assigned to a client and takes the orders. What makes this tick is the human to human connection between the sales rep and the target client. It gets messy when the sales reps leave (which happens often) or the client's needs are changing quickly. Unless you have an amazing face to face personality, a big ticket item that is frequently needed and can be easily marked up 50% to 75%, and a known target customer group that is largely stationary, this is probably not a great fit.

##Benefits of Dropshipping  
1. **Less Upfront Capital Required** - Since you do not need to purchase bulk inventory to start dropshipping your costs will be far lower than starting a traditional retail store or ecommerce store.  
2. **Easy to Start** - With dropshipping you won't have to worry about things like packaging, shipping, managing a warehouse, managing inbound returns (unless you choose to), or keeping your products in stock.  
3. **Low Overhead** - Since you are not keeping inventory in stock you have a much lower overhead to worry about. You do not need a 3PL of fulfillment service, have to build or rent a warehouse, have to pay warehouse workers, have to establish your own logistics, have to license warehousing software or robots, etc...   
4. **Flexible Location** - With Dropshipping you can do it from anywhere. You can be in a beach house in Bali selling winter coats in Canada.   
5. **Wide Selection of Products to Sell** - As a dropshipper you can sell virtually anything that is in stock and doesn't have any legal issues surrounding it (i.e. copyright infringing products). This gives dropshipping businesses ultimate control over what products they do and do not list.   
6. **More Free Time / Or Side Income** - Once you have built a successful dropshipping operation you can stop working your full-time job and spend more free time doing what you want if you wish OR you can use dropshipping as a ""side hustle"" to make side income. This is because once smoothed out and working correctly, dropshipping can be incredibly efficient to operate. This is especially true for dropshipping stores that sell only a few items and those items are not just trending at the moment. Of course, once you find success in dropshipping you might want to devote more time to it, but the reality is that it is possible to take control of your own time versus a more traditional 9 to 5 work model.      
7. **Easier to Test** - Because you have such little overhead and requirements, you can test out a dropshipping model quickly, easily, and inexpensively.     
8. **Easier to Scale** - In many ways dropshippping is easier to scale than a traditional retail or ecommerce operation. Again, this largely goes back to lacking physical inventory. As long as your process of making a sale and then ordering from the provider is smooth, scaling can be done with far lower effort.  

##Challenges of Dropshipping   
1. **No Inventory Control** - Since you are not manufacturing the products or buying in bulk, popular products will not always be available from your supplier. For example a new streetwear t-shirt brand gets hot suddenly and you list it for sale on your website as in stock but they sell out quickly. Having to adjust your own inventory controls separate to the marketplace can be time consuming and cumbersome. This might also lead to erroneous sales, a poor customer experience, and bad online reviews / word of mouth about your store. There are some ways to mitigate or automate this, but most of them are still not great or have gone out of business. This is something you want to have a complete understanding of for every product you list for sale.   
2. **Low Profit Margins** - The biggest drawback to a dropshipping operation is that you frequently will have to operate on thin or low profit margins. This gives you very little room for error and less budget for marketing/advertising.    
3. **Low Barrier to Entry** - Because dropshipping is so easy to start doing, once a succesful niche has been identified it can quickly get burried in competition that spent almost nothing to get started. Because of the low barrier to entry those competitors oftentimes will drive pricing down in the space and can survive on much thinner margins if they can sell at increased volumes due to the lower pricing.    
4. **Shipping Issues** - No warehouse, no 3PL or fulfillment service, means no control over the shipping. If you source from different suppliers (or even the same supplier with their own issues keeping products in stock) then you are going to run into issues and complaints from customers when it comes to shipping times/speed, and quality of delivery. That's just part of the game. To counter this you should buy your own products periodically to experience what your customers might experience and find ways to improve the customer experience from that angle.  
5. **Branding is Much Harder** - It is extremely difficult to brand a dropshipping store largely due to the fact that you won't have any retail signage or customized packaging. Difficult, but not impossible. Affiliates have long had this problem as well, and it is easily overcome with content marketing and content curation, but these can be expensive to perform and you have to invest in what the brand means as well.     
6. **Supply Chain Issues** - When a problem happens in one of your many supply chains, as was a frequent occurrence during the COVID pandemic, consumers will look to you for help. You need to be prepared to make up for lost deliveries, broken items, etc... This problem grows exponentially the more products you carry from different suppliers.    
7. **Hard to Find a Niche / Segment** - Because of how easy dropshipping is to get started, the mind-bogglingly amount of products available, and the various other drawbacks mentioned above - it can be extremely difficult for a dropshipper to find a niche or segment and settle into it. First timers might feel the temptation to sell a myriad of different unrelated products as if they were their own mini-Walmart or mini-Amazon. Fighting that temptation and sorting through all of the available options to find a specific product or set of products can be difficult.
8. **Platform Policies and Rules** - Some (*or every*) platform (*i.e. eBay, Etsy, FB Marketplace, Amazon, FB Ads, etc...*) where you can sell products may have rules dramatically limiting how you can build your dropshipping business. Make sure you familiarize yourself with these rules and policies before you start building on a platform, because if you are in violation they can easily delete it all and send you back to square 0.

##How to use This Subreddit to Become a Better Dropshipper
No lies, this sub (and others dedicated to the industry) are filled with spammers and scammers. They compound the difficulty in making dropshipping work as they often: provide low quality help/tools, try to sell stolen works, repeat basic knowledge about the industry, are not experts or even experienced in retail/ecommerce/dropshipping.

Your mods (and Automod) work hard to remove these bad actors, but we can only do so much and ultimately a handful always slip through the cracks.   

###How to Detect a Reddit Scammer/Spammer   
In general, it helps to be really skeptical of anyone's motives in this space, but here are some tips to help you avoid the scammers that want to steal your money and derail your journey.   

1. **Before you start believing someone look at their account.** Scammers and Spammers almost always have to create new accounts as they get banned by mods/admins frequently. A new account with low comment karma and a lot of comments that look identical or really similar should be a massive red flag.   
2. **Look for clues in what they are selling / promoting.** Scammers and spammers often try to do the least amount of work possible to rip you off. A big red flag is if they are trying to give you a course/ebook/webinar created by someone else. If they are giving it free, it's probably malware; if they are selling it then it could be outdated/incomplete and most likely is stolen (i.e. ill gotten gains). If they are promoting a website or SaaS or dropshipping related service then examine their motives and their connection.  
3. **Did they ask you to DM them or did they DM you?** This is almost exclusively going to be spam or scam related activity. Real businesses in dropshipping / retail / wholesale are either too damn busy for one-on-one DM conversations or they have a web team dedicated to these conversations that would be explained on their website, in videos, and across social media. Everything else is probably not worth it.   
4. **Are you being shown some eye-popping hard to believe Shopify sales screenshot or video?** This is a big one for scammers, they like to show a stolen or faked Shopify sales dashboard screenshot that has $x,xxx,xxx in sales over a 30-day period and claim to have the golden ticket for you to get the same amount for some low price. It sounds tempting and could be true, but it's probably snake oil and fraud instead.   

###General Tips on Using The Sub   

1. **Always flair your posts!** - (*note: this is now a requirement*) While new to the subreddit, flairing allows users who come here to be helpful with others a way to easily find your post and get involved in the conversation. Anyone requesting a site review, a product review, or marketing/copy/etc... review should use the ""Review Request"" post flair. Anyone trying to buy or sell a service (even if offered for free) should use the ""Marketplace"" flair. If you're asking a single question use the ""Question"" flair and if you're trying to start a discussion about an industry topic use the ""Discussion"" flair.   
2. **Stop being so dang vague!** - A lot of posters to this subreddit only give partial information in their posts. For example ""I'm having trouble with Facebook Ads, thoughts?"" This is low quality and anyone who is skilled in this industry and interested in helping others will just keep moving right past it. Get detailed with your questions and discussion topics and you'll likely get more back in return. 
3. **For those trying to promote their Mentorship/Agent/Designer/Marketing/etc... other services.** - Spamming the same comment over and over again will GET YOU BANNED. Please engage in AUTHENTIC discussion in this sub or leave. IF a link to your website is appropriate and naturally fits a conversation, then posting it is fine. Please walk a thin line and lean to the side of not spamming comments.  
4. **Stop trying to post exact-match anchor text SEO spam!** - Using our sub to make a long-form post using ChatGPT then linking one of those words to your website/page is really dumb. First off it doesn't work and probably hasn't since about 2009, Secondly the moment a mod sees it we will mark the post as spam and ban your account. Instead create engaging content for the sub, again if your link is a natural fit to the content or has more information then it would be naturally appropriate to include it.  
5. **No one is going to give you all of the secrets in one post!** - Not a single soul ever made money in this industry just doing what someone on Reddit told them to. If you want to build a business and be profitable you are going to have to do a lot of work on your own and learn a lot as you go. Do not make posts here asking tons of novice questions hoping the Jeff Bezos of Dropshipping will see it, take pity on you, and give you the secrets to being a millionaire. There is actually a secret and here it is - it is hard work. Instead, use our sub to ask SPECIFIC questions when you get stuck or bounce ideas off of other dropshippers.  



#II. Starting Your Dropshipping Business

##Selecting a Platform for Your Store
With Dropshipping you really just need 3 things: A website capable of closing sales, a product to sell, and a way to reach potential customers. A lot of new dropshippers get stuck on building the website as there are never-ending ways of building a site these days and even no-site options such as Facebook Marketplace, eBay, Amazon, and Etsy. 

When we ran a poll last year /r/Dropshipping overwhelmingly preferred one CMS over all other options: Shopify. 

See that poll here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/rv3ptc/mod_poll_best_website_platform_cms_for/

Shopify is cheap but not free. As of publication the ""Starter"" plan is only $1 / month usd but is usually $5 / month usd. They have free competitors such as Shift4Shop, Weebly, Ecwid, Wix, and BigCartel. 

Shopify also has competitors that cost money without a way to use them for free, even if the CMS itself is free. Those include:   

* WordPress+WooCommerce (free, but you will likely need paid plugins, a paid theme, and monthly hosting).    
* BigCommerce   
* Magento  
* Squarespace  
* LightSpeed    

Again, Shopify tends to win out against most competitors. In some cases WordPress+WooCommerce might make sense for you, especially if you are good at managing hosting or doing some light coding work and want to build custom things for your store eventually. 

##Preferred Apps for Shopify 
The power of Shopify's simple to setup and use system is amplified by the third-party market of apps on their app store. These apps range in price from apps that are free to those that charge a modest monthly fee, and the range in application giving Shopify stores a ton of functionality not native to Shopify itself. App fees on Shopify apps help the developers maintain the code and keep updating it and pay for their server expenses to operate the app.

This is a brief and non-comprehensive list of apps that are known to help Dropshipping merchants enhance their customer experience or increase sales in some fashion: 

**SEO:Image Optimizer Page Speed App (Avada)**  
URL: https://apps.shopify.com/avada-seo-suite  
Price: Free or $34.95/month  

What you can do: Compress images for faster page loading speed, more page speed options, broken link checker, meta tag optimization, alt attributes, and Google Search Console integration. 

*Note: a recent price increase on their paid plan from $29/month to $34.95/month. You probably want to look for a cheaper or free alternative if they just keep increasing the price. SEO is important, but most is handled by Shopify. Biggest need is image compression and other page speed optimization.*

**Jump Links**  
URL: https://apps.shopify.com/toc  
Price: $1.99/month or $9.99/month  

What you can do: Add a Table of Contents to your Shopify blog posts automatically. If you write long-form blog posts with HTML headings these will be turned into a TOC. The higher plan level allows you to automatically promote related products which helps increase sales and builds internal linking.

*Note: Lots of recent upgrades, only app that automates adding products to your blog. Great fit for dropshippers doing content marketing. Write great content, rank that content with SEO or drive traffic with social media, and grow sales.*

**Ryviu**  
URL: https://apps.shopify.com/ryviu  
Price: Free, $6.99/month, $9.99/month,  $19.99/month  

What you can do: Display reviews across your Shopify site wherever you want, import reviews with or without photos from a variety of sources, send emails to gather reviews from your own customers, add Question and Answer functionality to products. 

*Note: You may want to be careful importing reviews from other providers. However, the rest of the toolkit is pretty solid.*

**Ilana's JSON‑LD for SEO**  
URL: https://apps.shopify.com/json-ld-for-seo  
Price: $399 one-time fee  

What you can do: Add rich Schema markup to your Shopify site in JSON-LD format. Enhances how your products appear in search results. 

*Note: a recent price increase from $299 one-time to $399 one-time. Steep price for most. There are other ways to generate JSON-LD Schema for Shopify that are less expensive or even free if you know what you are doing.*  

**Pebblely AI** 
URL: https://apps.shopify.com/pebblely-ai
Price: Free, $19/month, $39/month 

What you can do: Pebblely allows you to make better product images using AI. Start with a source photo of your product and swap out the background for one of 17-pre defined photo-realistic backgrounds or describe your own to the AI.

**Shopify App Resources:**

##How to Select a Niche
The number one tip successful dropshippers and merchants give to newcomers is ""find the right niche and you'll be successful"". 

Unfortunately this is usually where the discussion ends and the new dropshipper is left wondering what it means. First off a niche is defined in the context of business as ""a specialized segment of the market for a particular kind of product or service."" For example Walmart, Amazon, and Target try to carry every product a consumer might need or want, but Microcenter wants to carry wider selection of computers and related electronics and Nebraska Furniture Mart focuses on furniture. Niche's can be broad like those two examples or even more narrowly defined such as a business that only sells phone cases with unique designs or a business that only sells coffee tables. 

So, how do you know which niche to target? How narrow or broad should your niche be? Should you start with only one product or build a massive store overnight? 

Slow down there killer, let's take this in smaller chunks and answer each question one at a time. 

**How do you know which niche to target?**  
Selecting a niche is hard and there is no one real answer that fits every dropshipper. There are, however, some general rules to help you get started.   
1. Stick with what you know - If you know a lot about building robots, or computers, or drones, or dolls then consider a niche in those areas. Is one of your parents an interior designer and as such you learned a lot about bathroom design growing up? Then consider bathrooms to be your niche. Sticking with what you know gives you a big advantage over most of the competition in the marketplace because most of your competitors big and small will have no knowledge and zero experience in the industry.    
2. Pick a niche you are passionate about - Maybe you're a lawyer and discover that your real passion is Warhammer 40K. You could start looking at just Warhammer as your niche or board / card games in general. Similar to being knowledgeable about an industry, being passionate about what you dropship will give you a leg up on competitors who are just trying to make the most profit as quickly as possible.       
3. Pick a niche with big ticket items - The simplest ways to make a lot of money is to make a lot of sales in small amounts or a few big sales. Think about a niche where the consumers are willing to pay big money, even without experience or passion for it you might be able to sell a few products and make a big profit.   
4. Pick a niche with low prices and high margins - Another way to make money quick is to sell a lot of products at a cheap price that consumers consider a good price or even a deal. The pricing and volume of consumer need/want drives most of the sales here and your passion or knowledge might be less important.   
5. Pick a nice that you are comfortable with - I know you have read or seen videos about how you can get rich fast with dropshipping. And while possible, it is probably more the exception than the norm. The reality is you will be doing this for at least a few years if not longer. So do not sell adult toys if you do not want to look at them daily, do not sell hygiene products for the opposite gender if it makes you uncomfortable.   

The important thing to remember here is that NO ONE can tell you which niche to select. You can get input from family, friends, mentors, and even get-rich-quick influencers and you can get data from tools that track trends, but you have to make the decision on what to target. For example if you sell real estate as your full-time career and have zero interest in fitness, even if all of the people you trust and tools you use tell you that fitness is a winning product niche, you should avoid it and find something that might be less of a great target but that you can stick with.

**How narrow or broad should your niche be?**   
That is up to you. A few things to keep in mind here there though:  
1. A narrow focus makes success easier in the short-term, but might provide friction to expanding your selection later.  
2. Single product or a few product stores using exact match or near exact match domains might sell well for a small period of time and perform well in SEO and could be good targets to resell later on if you do not want to stick with them, but often (not always) lack the branding potential for long-term success.  
3. A narrow focus is for easier to manage than a wide focus and vice versa. If you have only a little extra time to spare, then consider starting as small as possible.    
4. In some cases consumers consider a wide focus messy or untargeted but trust a narrow focus more and in other cases it is the exact opposite. Before deciding how wide to start you might do some cursory research or thought experiments. For example if you sell dehydrators for beef jerky and use the domain ""BeefJerkyDehydrators.com"" you will lose access to consumers who want to store fruits and vegetables or use it for other things, but you would win for anyone wanting to make just beef jerky.

#III. Marketing Your Dropshipping Store / Products
Understanding and executing great marketing is paramount for your dropshipping venture to be successful. This is an incredibly deep topic, which we will only be able to touch on a little bit here. 

##Possible Marketing Channels 
Before you spend any money on marketing, it is important that you understand what a marketing channel is and how you might use them. A marketing channel is essentially a tightly-related group of sources where you can run marketing or advertising campaigns. Marketers often think of these like ""buckets"" helping them to visualize where sales come from, understand what buckets provide the best sales for the money spent, what the cost of sales in each bucket might be, and if it would be possible to gain more sales from a certain bucket.   

* **Social Media Advertising** - Also called ""Paid Social"" or referred to as just the channel (i.e. Facebook Advertising). This is a marketing channel where you use photos or videos + advertising copy to reach your target audience and convince them to purchase your product. You pay each platform a fee, often in terms of number of people/accounts reached, in clicks to your site, or for a sale. 
* **Organic Search** - The marketing tactic that targets this channel is known as ""Search Engine Optimization"" or ""SEO"". This is where you attempt to position your website/pages higher in a general search engine by doing things that might give that engine signals that you are better to rank highly than other options. In most cases this takes time to drive sales and to be effective, but you do not pay the engine a penny. Instead your expenses here are focused on whatever you believe will gain the right collection of signals/scores to obtain the rankings you desire.   
* **Paid Search** - Also called ""PPC"" or ""Search Engine Marketing"" or ""Keyword Advertising"". This is where you buy ads on a search engine based on keywords your target customers might be using. Typically these ads are paid for on a per click basis or a target cost for each sale made.   
* **Organic Social Media** - Also known as ""Social Media Marketing"" or just ""Social Media"". This is where you/your store brand simply engage in online public forums collectively known as social media in hopes of driving sales. You can build your groups on Facebook, subreddits on Reddit, twitter accounts, etc... and try to gain as many members/followers as possible from your target audience. Then post messages / marketing materials to them.   
* **Content Marketing** - This is where you create content that your target customers might find really interesting or useful or funny. These target customers then help you by sharing the content on your behalf, driving Word-of-Mouth, and building inbound traffic. Some of that traffic can be shown products that they might want to purchase. Content can include blog posts, infographics, YouTube videos, podcasts, etc... 
* **Email Marketing** - This is where you send emails to non-customers or current customers to try and drive sales. You might also run your own email newsletter or buy ads in email newsletters and consider those part of this marketing channel.  
* **Podcast Advertising** - This is where you buy ads on Podcasts your audience might listen to in hopes of driving sales.  
* **Out of Home** - Also called ""OOH"" or ""Traditional"" this marketing channel includes things like billboards, bus benches, subway advertising, terrestrial radio, or other things that are often found by consumers while they are out and about in their city / area.  
* **Over the Top** - Ads on video streaming provides such as Roku and Hulu are often called OTT.  
* **Influencer Marketing** - Where you pay social media influencers with large followings to drive sales for your store.  
* **Public Relations** - Also called simply ""PR"" this is where you hire a PR agency or consultant to help you develop campaigns that seek to gain organic media mentions in the press, which then drives branded searches, which drives traffic to your website.   
* **Referrals** - A more nebulous channel where traffic and sales are derived from organic mentions that include links not placed or controlled by you, your staff, or your contractors/agencies. This is essentially tangential traffic that happened to come to your website and make a purchase and is difficult to build marketing plans for. For example if you did a PR promotion 4-years ago and a YouTuber talked about it, then included a link to this in their description, that link drove traffic, and some of those visitors purchased this might fall into your ""Referral"" channel because we know where they came from but did not use direct marketing to obtain the referring traffic. If this was a paid arrangement it would be our Influencer channel and if we determined it stemmed from our own social media work it would either go into our paid or organic social media channel. Because the origin is so hard to determine and because this channel is extremely difficult to target and optimize, especially as a beginner, you should just understand that it exists and focus efforts elsewhere knowing  there will be some bleed over.

## What Marketing Channels Other Dropshippers Find Successful  
We polled this subreddit to find what marketing channel dropshippers found the most successful.  You can view that poll here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/12avh86/mod_poll_what_marketing_channel_drives_the_most/

We asked ""What channel drives the most sales for your operation?""  
Here are the results:   

* **Paid Social** - 50.0%  
* **Social Media (unpaid)** - 21.73%  
* **SEO** - 17.39%  
* **Content Marketing** -  6.5%  
* **PPC** - 4.3%  

## Known Successful Marketing Approaches 
The sub will lend more details here later. Based on the above channels and experiences here are the approaches known to be successful. They are not always going to be successful:  

1. **Make a 9x16 video showing how the product works** (or hire someone to) and run this along with copy as a Facebook / Instagram / TikTok ad.  
2. **Invest in QUALITY SEO tactics** such as inbound PR for link building, writing great product descriptions, and making your site more technically sound.  
3. **Pay a social media influencer** to use your product for you. Works best on Instagram or Twitter or TikTok. FB Groups or Personal Facebook accounts might work too, but Facebook's algorithm destroys these kinds of posts on Pages.  
4. **Build a closed Group** and use it to sell or bounce ideas off of your audience. You can do this on Facebook, Reddit, Discord, or possibly even LinkedIn.  
5. **Setup a Google Merchant Center account** and gain free sales from Google or run Google Shopping Ads.  
6. **Do Content Marketing or Curation using a blog** and when it is a good fit recommend your related product(s) to readers.  You can run ads to these, share them to your social media audience, use email marketing channel, or just allow them to bring in organic search traffic.   
7. **Build a non-branded Humor-focused social media account.** On Twitter, IG, TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, or maybe even Reddit build a social media account that is focused on being funny about a topic or topics your target audience might be interested in. Then post your products to them from time to time or use this audience to drive traffic to another marketing channel (i.e. content marketing, email marketing, or paid social retargeting to name a few). For example an IG meme page for Nursing life called ""Nursing Memes"" for a store that sells scrubs.

dropshipping,Mod Update: New Rules Out - Ban Hammer Dropping,2023-07-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/14ox4r2/mod_update_new_rules_out_ban_hammer_dropping/,10,"Dropshippers, 

We have updated the rules in this sub and have began enforcing them with gusto today in hopes of ridding our community of predatory users that come here to try and scam others.

We have worked hard to make these rules fair, descriptive, and to ensure they will only adversely impact those who spam here in an attempt to scam or harm others.  

While these rules are technically new, they merely codify things we have already been enforcing and give a little more clarity as to what is happening.

Among the changes you might notice are banning users immediately if they reply to a post with phrases like ""come inbox"", ""check messages"", or ""inbox me"" - as well as clarity around what we consider to be ""Inauthentic Engagements"" i.e. various marketing tactics used to lure dropshippers into something that may not actually benefit them. 

The new posted rules also give the mod team the ability to take down posts that are not descriptive enough. Right now on the homepage there's a top voted post simply titled ""Dropshipping"". Low quality posts like this make it hard for interested users to actually get involved, attract mostly scammers, and overall drag this sub down. Starting today we may remove these posts as non-spam and simply mark the rule violation allowing the OP to repost with a higher quality title or content.

As users of this sub your input is highly valued. Please give us feedback on these rules and if there is something you would like to see us accomplish in the comments below."

Few days later, I get an offer for $8. I countered to $10. They re-countered to $9. Then it got me thinking, this buyer is most likely throwing offers to the other seller too. And once the new item sells, I’ll be able to increase my sales price. 

Sure enough, I see that the other seller sold their new one for a lower price. As a result, I rejected the counter and increased my price to $24. Within a few hours I get an offer from the same person for $21 ($20 was my min). I honestly didn’t expect that person to want to buy both items or come close to my price considering the counter offers. 

I’m a noob seller on eBay and not sure what I got myself into. I posted 2 decent pictures of the product (small item) but now thinking maybe I should’ve provided better pictures in case this person tries to hit me with a NAD.

Also it is common to lose sales because i offer them 5-10$ more than what they offered and there's 0 interest in negotiating other than the price they had in mind, (i'm talking about fair prices).

Flipping,(Updated) eBay wants me to refund before a return has been delivered,2023-10-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/17gd8z8/updated_ebay_wants_me_to_refund_before_a_return/,3,"EDIT: After 10 minutes of faffing with the ai chat helper I finally got a real person to talk with. They were able to put a 10 day hold on the return which should give USPS enough time to get the item back to me, I'm assuming after the 10 days the option to refund will reappear and I'll do so, problem solved! (maybe)

I'll leave this post up since it might help someone in the future, or a mod can delete it if they want.

&#x200B;

From the last post:

\[I'll try to keep this simple, the buyer opened a return\* and shipped it the next day, 2 days later it was sent back to the buyer and the last update on the tracking was ""MISSENT"" 5 days later I guess they shipped it again because now it says ""PROCESSED THROUGH USPS FACILITY-"" and ""In Transit to Next Facility"" twice, fair enough I can wait.

Here's the problem: Now if I look at the return page there's a green banner that says ""The item should already have been delivered."" and it says I have until the 26th to refund the buyer? The report problem button is no help either since it's just for issues with the item like if damaged/missing parts etc, but I don't have it.\]

\*Buyer stated they purchased the wrong item, so it's not INAD.

I could take the risk and refund now, hoping that it arrives without issue, though this was a $200+ sale.

Someone in the last thread said it could be ignored, but I'm not 100% sure so I attached an image of what I currently see, anyone else had this happen before?

my 1st day, boss mentions the WFH policy is 5 days a month, normally taken on fridays which was obviously contrary to what i was told in the interview process. i spoke to HR rep about my situation to see what could be done and im waiting to see what happens.

its important to note that i don’t have in writing them telling me i get to WFH 2-3 days a week but it was 100% told to me and was literally the biggest selling point of the job considering its a far drive.

what should i do?

im expecting them not to let me WFH 2-3 days a week. should i just ask for more money? i was thinking about completely renegotiating my offer and asking for at least a 10k raise.

He gave them prices and they paid upfront for the work they wanted. They had an established working relationship for a few years. I charged him hourly, it was three weeks of work. He also hired some guys I recommended for other work on the property. I invoiced him after the first week and he paid right away, and paid my friends.

They had a week of events so I was really pushing to get everything done before then, and almost did.   I had a day or two of work left, we decided I would go back later to finish. I invoiced him for the work I had done and he paid. Before I could go back he called and said not to, they were having issues. OK no problem, thanks again.

Later someone from the organization called and asked about the work that wasn't finished and I told them why. They said they felt that they were overcharged by the contractor for the work done and were trying to address that. I said I wouldn't do anymore work unless they paid me directly, which they understood.

When talking with the contractor I got the impression he was charging a lot, and it didn't seem like we were doing the work as thoroughly at the level of quality as we could have. The client mentioned what he charged for some specific things and it was pretty high. They asked me how much I had worked or charged for certain things. I said I didn't keep track of anything specific, I charged for the hours worked and any materials. They wanted me to forward them the two invoices.

Even though the contractor seems sketchy, I don't think it's appropriate for me to give out that information.  If he had specifically charged them for something and didn't actually buy it or something, I might mention that. They asked me about a few things and I verified that they were done, and one thing I wasn't involved in and I told them I couldn't give a definitive answer either way.  I don't think I should have to say anything else. 

To me, this is between them and the contractor and they are responsible for getting themselves in this situation. Thoughts?"

Long time lurker here...

I just wanted to share that after 2.5 years of opening my hummus business, I am finally profitable. I don't have a lot of friends who are business owners, and I just had to share it with someone who'll get it.

It started as a COVID project. I am a professional musician and during COVID, art kinda dies (like a lot of other industries), and I decided on a whim to try making and selling hummus. 

I've made every mistake in the book:

* Not doing any market research 
* Coming up with prices based on instinct 
* Hiring everyone and anyone who wanted a job
* Not setting up any systems, 
* Overpaying for ingredients, 
* Hiring almost any ""consultant"" who approached me with his solution to expand the business
* Trying to expand too fast
* Thinking that I'll make my ""exit"" in a year

and the list goes on.

But finally, after 2 years, things finally started to settle, and we've been able to bring in more than we spent 5 months in a row! 

Don't get me wrong, I'm still in the red when I look at the entire picture, but it's getting smaller.

Most importantly, I'm finally at a place where I can sponsor nonprofits, and was able to collaborate with local music organizations!

They “could” take on my full production capacity if they’re succuessful.

For them, it allows them to corner the market on an innovative prospect of material supply.

For me, the upside is that it’s easily manageable as I go through a startup phase, but it also has risks. What if they don’t end up buying enough product? 

What commercial terms should I include if I was to sign an exclusivity agreement? I would think that this would require me to have some sort of vested goal (i.e. a percentage of their sales on my supply) or they would need to garauntee me a minimum order quantity per year.

Has anyone dealt with this?

I'm mostly curious if there are any general rules of thumb when valuing a small retail business? I've read a few articles online but depending on which metrics you use, the valuations vary wildly. 
 
Basic business facts:  

- $800k gross revenue 
- $100k in inventory, only other assets are store fixtures  
- no large liabilities that I am aware of (will need to verify with financials of course)
- location is leased 
- one full time employee (me), and two part time employees (owner and one other person)
- owner takes home about $100k per year before taxes
- sole proprietorship
- sales are flat, not really down or up and has been this way for years (each year is within 0-3% of prior year)

Is that enough info to make a rough ballpark evaluation? I'm planning on speaking with an accountant once I get the financials, but I'm kind of curious what I should expect."

What we're looking for is:

* A way to track our customers. Their contact info, past sales, contact preferences, etc. 

* A way to generate, and print, invoices. The sales we do are COD, so there's no need for e-invoicing, online payments, etc. 

* Aggregate sales by a number conversion. Meaning...if we sell X-number of this item, it converts it to the number of gallons. This is more for tax reporting purposes. Not a deal breaker, but a nice to have. 

That's it! Ideally and online solution so my guy in the field can interface with it on his phone.
